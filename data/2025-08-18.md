### [1] [A2HCoder: An LLM-Driven Coding Agent for Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10904)
*Jie Lei,Ruofan Jia,J. Andrew Zhang,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2HCoder是一个基于大型语言模型的层次化算法到HDL编码代理，旨在解决算法设计与硬件实现之间的差距，通过模块化和逐步翻译提高可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统对超低延迟和功耗的需求增加，但算法设计与硬件实现之间存在显著差距，传统方法需要大量领域知识和手动开发。

Method: A2HCoder采用层次化框架，水平维度分解算法为模块化功能块，垂直维度逐步翻译，结合外部工具链调试和合成。

Result: 在5G无线通信领域的实际部署中验证了A2HCoder的实用性、可靠性和部署效率。

Conclusion: A2HCoder通过模块化和逐步翻译有效减少了LLM生成代码的幻觉问题，提升了硬件实现的正确性和效率。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low
latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for
efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and
substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.
Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and
time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between
high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages
(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing
manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose
A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large
language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable
algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework
that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common
hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,
A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,
simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical
dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs
step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as
MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured
process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level
correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the
5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,
and deployment efficiency.

### [2] [PersonaTwin: A Multi-Tier Prompt Conditioning Framework for Generating and Evaluating Personalized Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10906)
*Sihan Chen,John P. Lalor,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaTwin是一个多层次的提示条件框架，通过整合人口统计、行为和心理测量数据构建自适应数字孪生，显著提升了LLM在用户模拟中的准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在捕捉用户多维细微差别方面存在不足，需要一种更精确的用户建模方法。

Method: 提出PersonaTwin框架，结合多源数据，并通过医疗健康领域8,500多人的数据集进行系统评估。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaTwin生成的模拟效果接近理想设置，且在预测和公平性指标上与基于真实个体的模型表现相当。

Conclusion: PersonaTwin展示了LLM数字孪生方法在生成真实且情感丰富的用户模拟中的潜力，为个性化用户建模提供了有力工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling
and approximation of human behaviors, they often fail to capture the
multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce
PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive
digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data.
Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500
individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM
outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity
metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated
responses remain accurate and unbiased. Experimental results show that our
framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover,
downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on
individuals in terms of prediction and fairness metrics across both
GPT-4o-based and Llama-based models. Together, these findings underscore the
potential for LLM digital twin-based approaches in producing realistic and
emotionally nuanced user simulations, offering a powerful tool for personalized
digital user modeling and behavior analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究构建了一个计算框架，从新闻文章中自动提取公司风险因素，实验表明微调预训练语言模型优于零样本或少样本提示的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别公司风险对投资者和金融市场至关重要，但现有方法可能不足。

Method: 提出包含七个方面的风险因素分类框架，标注744篇新闻文章，并比较多种机器学习模型。

Result: 微调预训练模型表现优于LLMs（如LLaMA-2），分析27.7万篇新闻文章验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 从新闻中识别风险因素能为公司和行业运营提供深入洞察。

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the
well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a
computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news
articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as
supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news
articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language
models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our
experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying
risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better
on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg
news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could
provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

### [5] [Rule2Text: A Framework for Generating and Evaluating Natural Language Explanations of Knowledge Graph Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10971)
*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rule2Text框架利用大语言模型（LLMs）为知识图谱（KGs）中的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释，提升可访问性和可用性。通过多数据集实验和人类评估，优化了模型性能，并构建高质量数据集用于微调开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则因复杂性和标签习惯难以解释，Rule2Text旨在通过自然语言解释提升其可理解性。

Method: 使用多种LLMs（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）和提示策略（零样本、少样本等），结合人类评估和LLM-as-a-judge框架，构建数据集并微调Zephyr模型。

Result: 微调后解释质量显著提升，尤其在领域特定数据集中表现突出。LLM-as-a-judge框架与人类评估一致。

Conclusion: Rule2Text有效提升了知识图谱规则的可解释性，并通过开源代码和数据支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the
resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to
their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of
individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language
explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and
usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including
Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the
ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically
evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,
including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we
conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and
clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an
LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human
evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,
and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth
datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results
demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,
with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we
integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type
information. All code and data are publicly available at

### [6] [Improving Text Style Transfer using Masked Diffusion Language Models with Inference-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10995)
*Tejomay Kishor Padole,Suyash P Awate,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间缩放方法，用于提升掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）的生成质量，并在文本风格转换任务中验证了其优于自回归语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）因其可扩展性和训练简便性成为离散数据生成的前沿方法，但其生成质量仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间缩放方法，结合预训练嵌入模型的软值验证器，优化MDM的去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本风格转换任务中显著提升了生成质量，且优于现有的无分类器引导设置。

Conclusion: MDM结合验证器方法在离散数据生成中表现出色，为自回归模型提供了更好的替代方案。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a
viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its
scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms
for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general,
have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging
inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by
using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the
generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling
method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising
process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for
standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative
to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple
soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained
embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when
used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing
literature.

### [7] [SproutBench: A Benchmark for Safe and Ethical Large Language Models for Youth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11009)
*Wenpeng Xing,Lanyi Wei,Haixiao Hu,Rongchang Li,Mohan Li,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SproutBench，一个针对儿童和青少年LLM安全性的评估框架，填补了现有AI安全框架在未成年人保护上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全框架主要针对成人，忽视了未成年人在认知、情感和社会层面的独特脆弱性。

Method: 引入SproutBench，包含1,283个基于发展心理学的对抗性提示，评估47种LLM的安全性。

Result: 发现LLM在未成年人使用中存在显著安全隐患，如情感依赖和隐私风险，并揭示了安全性与风险预防之间的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为儿童中心AI设计提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

Motivation: LLMs在跨语言知识迁移中表现不佳，常产生幻觉，研究旨在揭示其成因和动态过程。

Method: 使用小规模Transformer模型和合成多语言数据集，分析模型在不同语言中表示的统一性及其影响因素。

Result: 发现跨语言表示的统一性是迁移的关键，其程度受事实与语言间互信息及语言提取难度的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs的跨语言迁移提供了新方向，并展示了可控实验环境的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer:
they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a
different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting
to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small
Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify
a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified
representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification
is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of
unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data
language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these
insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by
manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and
visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work
shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and
suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

*Andrew Wang,Sophia Hager,Adi Asija,Daniel Khashabi,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语言模型代理在复杂任务中应对计划失败的能力，发现现有模型难以适应环境反馈并制定备用计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型代理在面临外部失败时如何搜索替代方案以实现目标。

Method: 设计了一个专门的规划基准测试，要求代理从四千多个函数中搜索并组合调用，同时应对函数突然不可用等外部失败。

Result: 发现语言模型代理难以适应环境反馈并执行备用计划，即使搜索空间受限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前生成模型的关键挑战，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing
complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search
spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do
language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a
specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning
problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for
relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes
environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our
benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as
functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the
introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.
Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by
the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents
struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment
feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct
function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from
the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when
the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis
of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the
effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in
our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative
models as well as promising directions for future work.

*Martin Pavlíček,Tomáš Filip,Petr Sosík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种可重用、细粒度且主题无关的框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）中与极化相关的偏见，并通过俄罗斯-乌克兰战争的案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在下游任务中表现出偏见，尤其是在敏感话题上。尽管已有偏见检测和缓解技术，但仍存在未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 结合极化敏感的情感指标与合成的平衡数据集，使用预定义的语义类别评估LLMs的偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs对乌克兰的情感更积极，且在语义类别间存在显著差异，揭示了模型间的行为模式分歧。

Conclusion: 该框架支持自动化数据集生成和细粒度偏见评估，适用于多种极化驱动的场景和主题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks,
especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse,
gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although
significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,
certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,
granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases
in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines
polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated
balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of
semantic categories.
  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the
Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,
Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with
a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework
allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic
categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation
to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and
citizenship modification.
  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained
bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios
and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism used to
represent the meaning of sentences as directed acyclic graphs. In this paper,
we describe how real digital dictionaries can be embedded into AMR directed
graphs (digraphs), using state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models.
Then, we reduce those graphs in a confluent manner, i.e. with transformations
that preserve their circuit space. Finally, the properties of these reduces
digraphs are analyzed and discussed in relation to the symbol grounding
problem.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在真实应用中的可靠性，特别是在动态行业环境中的表现。

Method: 提出RAMP框架，通过迭代规划、工具调用、输出验证和生成建议来优化受众质量，并引入长期记忆存储。

Result: 在88个评估查询中，准确性提升28个百分点；模糊查询的召回率提升约20个百分点，用户满意度更高。

Conclusion: 研究为在动态行业环境中部署可靠的LLM系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI
agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks.
However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains
limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing
task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP
that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates
suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we
equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of
client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM
planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set
of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative
verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively
better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect
iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our
results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in
dynamic, industry-facing environments.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试缺乏自然且耗时的问题，MoNaCo填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过分解标注流程，手动生成并回答大量自然耗时问题。

Result: 前沿LLMs在MoNaCo上的F1得分最高为61.2%，存在召回率低和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: MoNaCo为跟踪LLMs在处理复杂信息查询问题上的进展提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying
information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions
that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for
humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural
and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of
intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To
build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and
manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs
evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and
hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that
better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world
information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource
for tracking such progress. The MONACO benchmark, codebase, prompts and models
predictions are publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco

Motivation: 现有模型在预测人类移动模式方面表现优异，但其对模式背后原因或语义的理解能力尚不明确。

Method: MobQA通过自然语言问答，评估LLMs对多样化人类GPS轨迹数据的理解能力，问题类型包括事实检索、多选推理和自由解释。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在事实检索上表现优异，但在语义推理和解释问题上存在显著局限，轨迹长度对模型效果有较大影响。

Conclusion: MobQA揭示了当前LLMs在语义移动理解方面的成就与局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human
mobility data through natural language question answering.
  While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains
unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic
meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework
for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning
daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer
pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise
data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form
explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal,
and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance
on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and
explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting
model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and
limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility
understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at

Abstract: Tulu, a low-resource Dravidian language predominantly spoken in southern
India, has limited computational resources despite its growing digital
presence. This study presents the first benchmark dataset for Offensive
Language Identification (OLI) in code-mixed Tulu social media content,
collected from YouTube comments across various domains. The dataset, annotated
with high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.984), includes
3,845 comments categorized into four classes: Not Offensive, Not Tulu,
Offensive Untargeted, and Offensive Targeted. We evaluate a suite of deep
learning models, including GRU, LSTM, BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN, and attention-based
variants, alongside transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). The BiGRU
model with self-attention achieves the best performance with 82% accuracy and a
0.81 macro F1-score. Transformer models underperform, highlighting the
limitations of multilingual pretraining in code-mixed, under-resourced
contexts. This work lays the foundation for further NLP research in Tulu and
similar low-resource, code-mixed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的干扰项生成方法只能捕捉群体错误模式，无法满足个体学生的诊断需求。

Method: 采用无训练的两阶段框架：第一阶段通过蒙特卡洛树搜索从学生错误答案中恢复推理轨迹；第二阶段基于推理轨迹生成个性化干扰项。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在140名学生中生成个性化干扰项效果最佳，并能推广到群体场景。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效生成个性化干扰项，提升诊断效果，并具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice
questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing
student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns
across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to
capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their
diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of
personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors
based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past
question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that
effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task
is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which
often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based
group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free
two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific
misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover
the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second
stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new
questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with
the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach
achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors
for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings,
highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Result: 在六种流行语言上实现SOTA性能，推理速度提升40%，无BLEU分数下降；结合蒸馏方法，速度提升2.6倍且性能更优。

Conclusion: Parasitic Dual-Scale Approach在多语言语音翻译中显著提升了效率和性能，适合本地部署。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development
of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs
simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter
sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance,
particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic
Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method
with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the
Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into
whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference
efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation.
Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over
the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理多模态不一致性、时间模式变化和类别不平衡问题，且未能捕捉事件级结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于现有基线，表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，HGRAG在问答性能上优于现有方法，检索效率提升6倍。

Conclusion: HGRAG通过跨粒度整合结构和语义信息，显著提升多跳问答效果和效率。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered
across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained
textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed
knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods
address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural
associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and
fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization
of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called
HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and
semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity
hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained
passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared
entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates
fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via
hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which
further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to
obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the
LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a
6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

Result: LLMs在形态复杂度高的谜题中表现差，但在与英语相似的特征中表现较好；词素分割提升了解题能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语言学推理和低资源语言建模中的挑战，建议开发更智能的语言特定分词器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks,
but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These
puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a
minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning
abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance
on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with
linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that
LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and
perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in
English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing
step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and
language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some
challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism
remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and
persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free
$\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert
$\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that
leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access
LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT
components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert
feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized
expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we
apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales
(32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized
domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit
reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness
($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for
domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional
annotated benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他语言和安全性分类任务，小模型在特定任务中可能优于大模型。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging.
While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in
French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally
relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new
public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a
semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10%
through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then,
we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight:
Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and
generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we
propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic
weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision,
significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline
and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a
cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability,
suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages
and safety-critical classification tasks.

Result: 模型间情感表达差异显著，焦虑问题引发高恐惧，抑郁问题引发高悲伤，压力问题引发乐观。人口统计特征影响较小。

Conclusion: 模型选择对心理健康应用至关重要，因其情感特征可能显著影响用户体验和结果。

Abstract: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that
increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini
Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty
pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions
are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and
university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for
sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that
optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all
outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.
Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as
anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly
influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels
of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama
demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental
health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts
elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated
elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while
stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with
elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced
only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed
significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while
demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical
importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM
exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user
experience and outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SafeConstellations的方法，通过跟踪任务特定的轨迹模式，减少LLMs的过度拒绝行为，同时保持模型的一般性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的安全机制导致模型拒绝表面上类似有害内容的良性指令，降低了生产应用的实用性。

Method: 通过分析嵌入空间中的轨迹模式，提出SafeConstellations方法，选择性引导模型行为。

Result: 该方法将过度拒绝率降低高达73%，且对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SafeConstellations为减少过度拒绝提供了一种原则性方法，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms
cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful
content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that
repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely
on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).
Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse
responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to
appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow
distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations
traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift
predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce
SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks
task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal
pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to
over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces
over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a
principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

Conclusion: SGSimEval为ASG提供了更全面的评估方法，未来需进一步优化内容和参考文献生成。

Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that
traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent
advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent
systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable
approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this
domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,
including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on
LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced
Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating
assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines
LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted
evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics
that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive
experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable
superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for
improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics
maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model
compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely
accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per

Conclusion: 信号处理技术为LLM生成文本检测提供了高效且可解释的新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free
approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and
overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this
work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel
paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency
domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the
global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits
significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the
larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the
suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we
construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the
global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version,
SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further
boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time.
Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for
LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing
techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

Abstract: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning
progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist
teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and
personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich
formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as
these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers
often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they
evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting
such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using
the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between
indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback
criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant
strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of
indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a
promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using
LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable
and transparent formative feedback in future research.

*Ryan Sze-Yin Chan,Federico Nanni,Tomas Lazauskas,Rosie Wood,Penelope Yong,Lionel Tarassenko,Mark Girolami,James Geddes,Andrew Duncan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合推理与检索增强生成（RAG）的轻量级语言模型架构，适用于资源受限或安全敏感环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统依赖大规模模型和外部API，难以满足高效、隐私保护的需求。

Method: 采用密集检索器与微调的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型结合，利用合成查询生成和前沿模型推理轨迹。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升答案准确性和一致性，接近前沿模型性能，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 该方法在轻量级架构中实现了高性能，代码公开以支持跨领域应用。

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model
architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models
and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and
privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure
environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and
small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational
agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a
lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with
fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and
reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a
curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the
impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and
reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both
non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our
domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer
accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while
remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code
are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度优化的新方法，通过掩码输入部分生成神经网络的提取性解释，适用于文本和图像输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域的快速发展，对黑盒模型预测解释的需求日益增长。

Method: 使用梯度优化结合新正则化方案，确保生成的解释满足充分性、全面性和紧凑性。

Result: 方法在文本和图像分类任务中均生成高质量解释，表明自然语言处理中的条件可推广到其他输入类型。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练专用模型，仅基于分类器即可实现解释生成，填补了模型可解释性与依据提取之间的空白。

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based
models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need
for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has
risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for
predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the
input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective
class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a
new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and
compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be
desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language
processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and
rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed
without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained
classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high
quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the
conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are
more broadly applicable to different input types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端可微训练范式，用于稳定训练合理化Transformer分类器，简化了传统三玩家游戏方法，提高了效率并避免了训练不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖三个独立模型（合理化选择器、分类器和互补分类器），训练复杂且不稳定，需要简化并提高效率。

Method: 通过单一模型同时完成三个角色，简化训练范式，并结合参数化和正则化技术生成类别相关合理化。

Result: 显著提高了与人类标注的对齐性，无需显式监督即可达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了训练流程，提高了稳定性和效率，同时实现了更好的合理化效果。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training
of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single
model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on
their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used
three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on
training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We
simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,
leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the
common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we
extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating
recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,
thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with
human annotations without any explicit supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过简单方法调整大型语言模型的价值观系统，而不需要大量训练数据。

Result: 微调后模型在问卷回答和下游任务中表现出显著的行为变化。

Conclusion: 简单方法可有效调整模型的价值观系统，影响其行为。

Abstract: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet
steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate
a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream
behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first
construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a
series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which
we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether
the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value
surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two
ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey
questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in
out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a
contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate
changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate
that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain
survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in
implicit downstream task behavior.

TL;DR: HumorPlanSearch是一个模块化流程，通过多阶段建模上下文提升AI生成幽默的质量，实验显示其效果显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成幽默时内容泛泛、重复或不合时宜的问题，因幽默高度依赖上下文和文化背景。

Method: 提出HumorPlanSearch流程，包括计划搜索、幽默思维链模板、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订。

Result: 实验表明，完整流程（知识图谱+修订）将幽默生成评分（HGS）提升了15.4%（p < 0.05）。

Conclusion: 通过全程关注上下文，HumorPlanSearch使AI生成的幽默更连贯、适应性强且文化敏感。

Abstract: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply
situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and
immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that
explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored
strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and
stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt
high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic
embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate
context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score
(HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates,
and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13
human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent
(p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from
strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances
AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论时的困难，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化内容审核系统可能错误地将反性别歧视言论标记为有害，从而压制挑战性别歧视的声音，影响在线民主辩论。

Method: 研究分析了五种LLMs对英国2022年涉及女性议员的性别歧视、反性别歧视及中性政治推文的分类表现。

Result: 模型在政治敏感事件中频繁将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，导致边缘化声音被压制。

Conclusion: 研究建议改进审核设计，避免二元分类，增加人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反歧视言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样器和模型融合策略，解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）任务联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要一种方法在统一框架中协调这两种任务的不同需求。

Method: CoDiEmb采用任务专用目标、动态采样器、delta引导的模型融合策略和高效的单阶段训练流程。

Result: 在15个标准基准测试中，CoDiEmb不仅缓解了任务间的性能权衡，还改善了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb为统一文本嵌入学习提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了补充信息的内容和格式对使用LLMs进行情感分析的影响，发现JSON格式提示优于自然语言提示，适合资源受限的设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP研究仅从评论文本分类情感，而营销理论指出客户评价还受其他参考点影响，因此研究补充信息对情感分析的作用。

Method: 比较自然语言和JSON格式提示，使用轻量级3B参数模型，实验基于Yelp的餐厅和夜生活类别。

Result: JSON提示表现最佳，Macro-F1提升1.6%和4%，RMSE降低16%和9.1%，且性能提升源于真实上下文推理。

Conclusion: 结构化提示可使小模型达到竞争力表现，为大规模模型部署提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields,
including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms
understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from
review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and
expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are
shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference
points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such
supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare
natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B
parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on
two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with
additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1
rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it
deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up
analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning
rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting
can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a
practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出物种主义偏见，并评估其对非人类动物的价值。通过三个范式分析，发现LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在权衡中更倾向于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，研究其伦理倾向至关重要，尤其是对非人类动物的歧视问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：SpeciesismBench基准测试、心理学测量比较模型与人类反应、文本生成任务。

Result: LLMs能检测物种主义言论但常视为道德可接受，在权衡中更倾向于人类，但对认知能力平等的个体无物种偏好。

Conclusion: 需扩展AI公平性框架以明确包含非人类道德主体，减少物种主义偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学和神经科学长期面临区分语言表征与概念意义表征的挑战，语言模型中也存在类似问题。

Method: 通过两个神经指标（大脑激活水平和跨模态意义一致性）分析LM-大脑对齐关系。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型在意义一致性更强的脑区预测信号更准确，即使这些区域对语言处理不敏感。

Conclusion: 语言模型可能内部表征跨模态的概念意义。

Abstract: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of
disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual
meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we
investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural
metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,
targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency
across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region
responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)
using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both
language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more
meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly
sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally
represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体的心理健康评估框架，模拟医患对话，通过动态交互和迭代提问提升评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康评估依赖专业医生，资源有限；现有AI方法多基于静态文本分析，无法捕捉动态交互中的深层信息。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上验证，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了心理健康评估的深度和效率，为自动化评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective
treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the
shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most
existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,
limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that
emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation
that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents
assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We
introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent
assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of
generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing
information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root
node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and
statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories
and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the
interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information
extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the
DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which
achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Result: 减少49.27%的响应token，提升6.59倍token效率，训练时间减少5倍。

Conclusion: DR. SAF在资源有限环境下表现优异，甚至超越传统指令模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,
impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time
applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on
human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared
difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic
Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to
dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem
complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness
Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.
These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing
efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response
tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain
in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited
to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass
traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%
accuracy improvement.

Method: 第一阶段将原始音频转换为基于人类耳蜗的时频表示，提取离散的耳蜗标记；第二阶段对标记应用自回归序列模型。

Result: AuriStream在SUPERB语音任务中表现优异，能生成可解码为音频的语音延续。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架为语音表示学习提供了新方向，推动了更接近人类听觉的模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech
via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy.
The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based
on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}.
The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear
tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and
state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on
diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong
representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be
visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing
insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage
framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more
human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

Motivation: 现有视觉蕴含数据集规模小且稀疏，手动创建耗时费力。

Method: 利用SNLI文本前提通过Stable Diffusion生成图像，替换文本前提，构建合成数据集。

Result: 合成数据训练效果接近真实数据，F-score在SNLI-VE上为0.686（真实数据0.703），在SICK-VTE上为0.384（真实数据0.400）。

Conclusion: 在数据稀疏场景下，合成数据是训练视觉蕴含模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training
visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and
sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets
is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for
textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a
generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each
textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.
For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by
using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP
feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight
drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when
trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training
data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is
only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that
in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for
training visual entailment models.

significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

Conclusion: 指出了现有研究的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG、NASA、NAG）在负提示引导方面存在不足，VSF旨在更高效地抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制内容，计算开销小，兼容多种架构（如MMDiT、Wan）。

Result: 实验表明，VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，且在非少步模型中也能超越CFG，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且通用的负提示引导方法，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [48] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。APR虽然是一种有前景的解决方案，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常能获得更高精度。

Method: 扩展PAE到RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，通过基于PAE的RPR优化APR预测。首先验证PAE-based RPR的有效性，然后展示其在提升APR定位精度上的效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在室内基准测试中显著提升了APR的定位精度，且在仅使用30%数据训练时仍能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合PAE和RPR，显著减少了零售部署中的数据收集负担，同时保持了高定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，性能优于现有基线，并用于标注大规模视频数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，以支持空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过高效处理视频，估计相机内参、运动和密集深度图，支持多种相机模型和场景。

Result: ViPE在TUM/KITTI序列上比现有基线表现更好（18%/50%提升），并在单GPU上以3-5FPS运行。

Conclusion: ViPE及其标注的数据集开源，旨在加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭集3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法在几何质量上存在不足。

Method: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，包含IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态一致性和标注类几何先验优化伪标签。

Result: 相比现有方法，新类别的mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著提高。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或插件，为开放词汇检测提供高质量伪标签。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有视觉方法在3D语义占用预测中因密集3D体素或2D平面特征导致的高通信成本或深度估计依赖问题。

Method: 利用稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅，通过共享和融合高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码及稀疏通信。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别比单代理和基线协作方法提升8.42、3.28和5.11、22.41点，通信量减少至34.6%时仍保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作场景中高效且鲁棒，显著提升了感知性能并降低了通信负担。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的身份解耦与拟合方法（IDFSR），用于在极端退化场景下提升人脸超分辨率（FSR）的身份一致性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化（如缩放>8倍）时难以保持身份一致性，容易生成虚假人脸。

Method: 通过掩蔽、对齐参考图像和利用身份嵌入，结合扩散模型解耦风格与身份，并进行轻量级微调。

Result: IDFSR在极端退化场景下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦与拟合有效解决了极端退化下的身份一致性问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中虚拟与现实结合的物体增多，识别这些物体（如Artcodes）是触发后续交互的第一步。

Method: 提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图），用于描述Artcodes的拓扑结构，并构建了一个检测系统进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该特征描述符能有效表示拓扑结构，检测系统在Artcode识别上表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管是初步尝试，但该研究为拓扑物体检测开辟了新方向，并可能激发更多应用。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character

frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、医疗影像）中具有潜力。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Result: 现有模型在多阶段临床推理任务中表现不佳，MedAtlas揭示了性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医学AI提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net是一种基于深度学习的FOD增强框架，显著提升了临床扩散MRI数据的分析效率和准确性，适用于多种神经系统疾病研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床扩散MRI数据中FOD估计的可靠性和准确性不足的问题，尤其是在单壳低角度分辨率采集条件下的挑战。

Method: 开发了FastFOD-Net，一种加速的端到端深度学习框架，用于增强FOD，并在健康对照和六种神经系统疾病中进行了验证。

Result: FastFOD-Net在性能上优于现有方法，训练和推理效率显著提升（比前代快60倍），并在临床评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net有望加速临床神经科学研究，提升扩散MRI分析的可靠性和效率，推动深度学习在临床中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但数据质量、复杂任务表现和评估协议的不足限制了其可靠性和广泛应用。受人类利用外部工具启发，研究探索如何通过工具增强MLLMs。

Method: 通过四个维度分析外部工具的作用：数据获取与标注、下游任务性能提升、模型评估改进、当前局限与未来方向。

Result: 外部工具在提升MLLMs数据质量、任务表现和评估准确性方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 外部工具对MLLMs的发展具有变革性潜力，未来需进一步探索其应用与优化。

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在对象属性推理上的能力，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏多样性和复杂性，需要更系统的评估框架。

Method: 设计了包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种对象属性的评估框架，并构建了ORBIT基准（360张图像和1,080个问题）。

Result: 12个先进视觉语言模型在零样本设置下表现不佳，最高准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的不足，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准和更强的推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统中因视觉模糊（如同色异谱现象）导致的弱势道路使用者识别问题。

Method: 结合信息论技术和图像质量指标，提出波段选择策略，从高光谱数据中筛选最具信息量的波段。

Result: 选定的HSI波段在多个指标上显著优于RGB图像，减少了同色异谱混淆。

Conclusion: 该方法为高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和自动驾驶（AD）提供了更可靠的感知输入，有助于提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升生成效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet）在可控生成中存在计算冗余和延迟问题，尤其在视频生成中更为明显。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区计算，时间上选择性跳过冗余去噪步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍以上的速度提升，生成质量几乎无损失。

Conclusion: EVCtrl为可控生成提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，特别是低视力人群的视觉感知。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建基准数据集，设计不同提示组合（视力信息、示例响应）让VLM（GPT-4o）模拟参与者，并评估其响应一致性。

Result: 仅提供少量提示时，VLM倾向于过度推断，一致性低（0.59）。结合视力信息和示例响应显著提高一致性（0.70）。单一示例（开放式+选择题）效果优于单独使用，额外示例无显著提升。

Conclusion: VLMs在模拟低视力人群视觉感知时需结合具体信息和示例响应，单一示例已足够，额外信息无显著帮助。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Motivation: 现有VLM在建筑安全检查中的应用受限于小规模监督数据集，缺乏开放数据集以全面评估和优化模型。

Method: 构建包含1万张图像的数据集，支持图像描述、安全违规视觉问答和建筑元素视觉定位三项任务。

Result: 评估显示当前VLM在零样本和小样本设置中表现良好，但需进一步训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究者提供了训练和评估VLM的基准，推动建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型（如MedSAM）因数据有限、标注稀缺和分布偏移等问题，泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出零阶优化方法，自动发现最优层合并方案，并通过单任务和多目标优化满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix显著提升性能，专业任务和多任务评估分别提高6.67%和4.37%。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过模型合并有效减少偏差，提升医学图像分割的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VL数据集在远距离对象和多视角推理方面存在不足，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 引入MV-ScanQA数据集测试多视角推理，TripAlign数据集提供2D-3D-语言预训练语料，开发LEGO方法进行知识迁移。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign为3D VL学习提供了更丰富的多视角和多对象对齐信号，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖者中糖尿病的分布差异提示腹部体成分可能揭示更多信息。

Method: 通过AI从临床CT中提取腹部结构特征，使用随机森林分类和SHAP分析识别糖尿病相关模式。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、内脏脂肪等是共同特征。

Conclusion: 腹部特征可能是跨体重类别的2型糖尿病驱动因素。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将3D对象视为整体，忽略了语义部分层次结构，且高分辨率建模计算成本高，而真实物体具有稀疏性和层次性。

Method: 采用多尺度八叉树扩散模型，引入跨注意力机制注入部分级信息，并构建带部分类别标注的3D数据集。

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层生成和语义特征传播，显著提升了3D内容生成的效果。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MICC方法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the

promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the

structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released

Motivation: 现有去雾方法难以处理真实世界厚雾场景，主要原因是缺乏真实配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM是一种高效的去雾方法，尤其适用于真实世界厚雾场景。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 在遥感场景中，源域数据常因隐私和传输限制不可用，导致传统域适应方法受限。SFOD虽无需源数据，但易因伪标签噪声导致训练崩溃。

Method: VG-DETR引入视觉基础模型（VFM）指导伪标签挖掘，并通过双级对齐方法（实例级和图像级）增强特征表示。

Result: 实验表明，VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过结合VFM和半监督学习，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉内容评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: IOVQA通过约束模型输出为整数范围[10,50]，并将十进制Overall_MOS转换为整数标签，同时引入目标掩码策略，仅计算前两位数整数的损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: IOVQA展示了仅使用整数标签微调的有效性，为优化视觉语言模型在定量评估场景中的性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

Method: 提出IDOD方法，包括独立多样性增强模块、联合新颖性发现模块和正交性增量模块。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了连续类别发现的挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有适配器方法通过显式空间邻近性对齐视觉和文本模态，但无法捕捉类别与图像样本之间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: LatHAdapter引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，并在双曲空间中投影类别、属性和图像，通过层次正则化学习潜在语义层次结构。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter优于其他微调方法，特别是在已知类别适应和未知类别泛化方面。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过潜在语义层次结构建模，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间上存在局限性，GVT旨在通过生成2D高斯和分离静态与动态内容提升性能。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GVT通过空间自适应和时间分离策略，显著提升了视频处理的性能。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: CHARM3R通过优化深度估计，显著提升了单目3D检测器在相机高度变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂空间语义和实时性要求，限制了其在结构化空中推理任务中的应用。

Method: 提出UAV-VL-R1模型，采用监督微调（SFT）和多阶段强化学习（RL）的混合训练方法，利用GRPO算法提升结构化推理能力。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本准确率上比基线模型提高48.17%，甚至在部分任务中优于36倍大的模型，同时内存占用低，支持实时部署。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过GRPO强化学习弥补了SFT在数学任务中推理多样性的不足，实现了高效、轻量化的航拍图像推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Result: 在COCO keypoint和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在轻量化同时提升了姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Result: 实验表明，UMM在模态不确定条件下表现出强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶中的行人重识别提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个稳健的性别偏见评估框架，揭示了视觉语言模型中潜在的性别刻板印象问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: 通过类别级几何学习和一致性对齐，显著提升了3D语义分割的域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Motivation: 组合图像检索（CIR）任务需要同时理解参考图像和修改文本指令，现有方法通常需要额外训练排序模型，且Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术在CIR中的应用有限。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR在监督CIR任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架通过简单有效的模块和范式，显著提升了CIR任务的性能，且代码将公开。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Result: SAEs特征具有语义意义，提升分布外泛化能力，并支持可控生成。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中展现出提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性的潜力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了单目内窥镜重建的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TimeMachine通过新颖的设计和高质量数据集，成功解决了面部年龄编辑中的挑战。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Conclusion: 去噪-检索范式可提升视频时刻检索性能，并适配其他先进模型。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Result: LogicCLIP在逻辑理解任务上显著优于基线模型，同时在通用视觉语言任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLM的逻辑能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的有效性，nuScenes测试集AMOTA达70.3%。

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过一致性空间模式匹配，显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）因噪声不稳定性导致性能波动，需大量噪声采样以稳定结果，降低了分类速度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了NoOp的有效性，显著提升了分类稳定性。

Conclusion: NoOp通过学习匹配噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，提升了分类速度和性能。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过合成数据精确控制变量，以量化和减少人脸识别系统中的偏见，同时满足监管要求（如欧盟AI法案）。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3（身份保留生成）和扩散模型（属性控制），生成10,000张平衡的人脸数据，并通过自动检测和人工审核验证真实性。

Result: AdaFace在减少组间TPR差异方面表现最佳（降低60%），光照是剩余偏见的主要因素（占42%）。合成数据在跨数据集评估中表现出强迁移性（r=0.85）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复、符合监管的标准，尽管计算开销略高，但能生成更多属性条件变体，支持透明和可扩展的偏见评估。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

*Mingxiao Ma,Shunyao Zhu,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAQD的新蒸馏方法，用于解决基于Transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于Transformer的增量目标检测中，传统的匈牙利匹配方法可能导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保持旧类别的检测性能。

Method: 提出Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，仅在关键查询上进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 实验表明，IAQD有效减轻了知识遗忘，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种有效的解决方案，适用于基于Transformer的增量目标检测任务。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“主动标注”的方法，通过减少人工标注成本，高效构建具有代表性的宫颈细胞分类训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宫颈细胞自动分类方法需要大量代表性训练数据，但人工标注成本高昂甚至难以负担。

Method: 利用分类器对未标注宫颈细胞图像的不确定性，选择最有价值的图像进行标注，从而降低人工成本。

Result: 新算法通过快速估计不确定性，显著提升了训练数据集的代表性，实验证实其高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据高效的宫颈细胞分类提供了可行途径，有效降低了人工成本。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击中的目标标签选择方法依赖随机性、模型预测或静态语义资源，缺乏可解释性、可重复性和灵活性。

Method: 使用BERT、TinyLLAMA和CLIP等预训练模型作为相似性来源，选择与真实标签最相关和最不相关的标签，构建最佳和最差对抗场景。

Result: 实验表明，预训练模型能提供实用的对抗目标，优于WordNet等静态数据库，尤其在远距离类别关系上表现更优。

Conclusion: 预训练模型适合构建可解释、标准化和可扩展的对抗基准，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: HOID-R1是一个结合了链式思维（CoT）引导的监督微调（SFT）和组相对策略优化（GRPO）的HOI检测框架，通过强化学习提升性能，并在开放世界泛化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇HOI检测方法过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了3D空间理解能力，HOID-R1旨在弥补这一不足。

Method: 结合CoT引导的SFT和GRPO，通过强化学习优化策略，并引入MLLM监督机制减少幻觉。

Result: 在HOI检测基准上达到最先进性能，并在开放世界泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和强化学习，显著提升了HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

TL;DR: RETFound首次被应用于视盘分割任务，仅需少量任务特定样本训练即可超越现有分割专用网络，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RETFound基础模型在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证其在非原始任务中的适应性。

Method: 通过训练一个轻量级头部网络，将RETFound适配到视盘分割任务，并在多个公开和私有数据集上进行测试。

Result: 在IDRID、Drishti-GS等数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，表现优于现有分割专用网络。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现出色，支持基础模型作为任务特定架构的替代方案。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估拓扑保持损失函数（如SRL）在管状结构分割中的有效性，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 对SRL的梯度进行理论分析，并在多个管状数据集上与传统基线模型进行性能比较。

Result: SRL在管状数据集上的表现未超过传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例级细节和复杂关系结构方面表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Method: 提出两种新颖的损失函数：实例级嵌入蒸馏（动态硬挖掘策略）和关系型成对相似性蒸馏（记忆库机制和样本挖掘策略）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有蒸馏方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型的准确率。

Conclusion: 统一框架通过同时优化实例级对齐和样本间几何关系，实现了更全面的知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖输入图像，而G-CUT3R利用深度、相机标定或位置等辅助数据，提升重建效果。

Method: 对CUT3R进行轻量级修改，为每种模态设计专用编码器，通过零卷积融合特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了性能，并能灵活适应不同输入模态。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R能有效利用先验信息，兼容多种输入模态，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

TL;DR: RMFAT是一种轻量级循环框架，用于高效恢复受大气湍流影响的视频，显著降低计算负担并提升实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量严重下降，现有方法计算成本高且难以实时部署。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码以及时间扭曲模块。

Result: 在清晰度恢复（SSIM提升9%）和推理速度（运行时间减少四倍）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RMFAT适用于实时大气湍流抑制任务，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Conclusion: SelfAdapt是一种有效的无监督自适应方法，可作为Cellpose框架的扩展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use

Motivation: 生物特征识别广泛应用，但模板隐私和安全性是关键问题，尤其是使用同态加密时的高计算负担。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取特征，通过维度缩减减少同态加密的计算量，并在虚拟多模态数据库上进行实验。

Result: 多模态融合可将模板尺寸减少67%，且等错误率（EER）不劣于单模态最佳性能。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合在保持安全性和准确性的同时，显著提升了加密处理的效率。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要结合多模态上下文理解和精确预测，而VLM和DWM各自擅长行为预测和场景生成，但两者的整合尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出ImagiDrive框架，将VLM驱动的驾驶代理与DWM驱动的场景想象器结合，通过迭代优化规划决策。引入早期停止机制和轨迹选择策略以提高效率。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上的实验表明，ImagiDrive在开环和闭环条件下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，实现了更鲁棒和高效的自动驾驶规划与场景生成。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Conclusion: 需要更鲁棒的解决方案来处理真实世界的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

TL;DR: CoFi是一种粗到细的少样本分割方法，用于电子显微镜图像中的肾小球基底膜分割，减少标注负担并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注，临床实用性低；少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构。

Method: CoFi先用三张标注图像训练轻量网络生成粗分割掩码，再通过形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，指导SAM细化分割。

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，显著减轻标注和计算负担。

Conclusion: CoFi高效准确，适合研究和临床应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Conclusion: 本研究为建筑行业数据驱动方法的发展提供了支持，并提出了未来数据基础设施的战略方向。

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多镜头视频生成研究尚不成熟，现有方法在镜头过渡方面表现不佳，限制了生成视频的多样性。

Method: 构建Cine250K数据集，利用扩散模型的注意力映射设计掩码控制机制，实现训练自由的过渡控制。

Result: CineTrans在多镜头视频生成中显著优于现有基线，过渡更稳定且符合电影编辑风格。

Conclusion: CineTrans为多镜头视频生成提供了有效的解决方案，并通过专用评估指标验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用感知-规划分离的范式，限制了规划性能的优化。本文旨在通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，提升自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 设计了感知与规划耦合的框架VeteranAD，利用多模态锚定轨迹作为规划先验，引导感知模块收集相关交通元素，并采用自回归策略逐步预测未来轨迹。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上的实验表明，VeteranAD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，显著提升了端到端自动驾驶的性能，证明了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: CNN在视觉识别任务中表现优异，但其依赖规则网格结构，难以建模复杂拓扑关系和非局部语义。

Method: HGFE构建了两种互补的图结构：局部空间依赖的窗口内图卷积和全局语义关系的窗口间超节点交互，并引入自适应频率调制模块平衡信号传播。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-100、PASCAL VOC等）上的实验验证了HGFE在提升结构表示和整体识别性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、端到端可训练的模块，可无缝集成到标准CNN中，显著提升视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AIM显著提升可解释性（EPG分数）和准确性。

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进真实特征的使用，提升泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

Motivation: 现有高效跟踪器因降低计算复杂度和模型参数而牺牲了特征表示能力，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST利用多状态生成（MSG）生成多阶段状态表示，通过SSE进行目标特定增强，并通过CSI模块实现状态间的交互和互补特征整合。

Result: MST在多个数据集上表现优于先前的高效跟踪器，显著提升了跟踪准确性和鲁棒性，计算开销仅为0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计有效解决了高效跟踪器中特征表示不足的问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理过程中缺乏可解释性且性能不足，Veason-R1旨在通过结构化推理和强化学习解决这些问题。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）初始化训练模型，结合高质量CoT数据和奖励机制优化推理链。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS），性能显著提升（+1.3 J &F和+10.0 J &F），且抗幻觉能力增强（+8.8 R）。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和强化学习，显著提升了视频推理分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的训练免费异常生成框架AAG，通过改进交叉注意力和自注意力机制，生成逼真的异常图像，提升下游异常检测任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测面临数据稀缺问题，现有异常生成方法缺乏逼真性或需要额外训练数据。

Method: AAG利用Stable Diffusion，结合掩码和文本提示生成异常图像，提出交叉注意力增强（CAE）和自注意力增强（SAE）机制。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、逼真的异常生成方法，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题。

Method: 提出TrajSV框架，包含数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)，采用无监督的三重对比损失优化表示。

Result: 在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现优异，检索性能提升70%，动作识别在17类中9类领先，字幕性能提升20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现出色，解决了现有问题，并通过实际部署验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型（VideoLMs）中，时间信息的编码主要依赖于帧间注意力机制，而非位置编码（PEs）。通过分析，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频语言模型中时间理解（如事件顺序、持续时间和关系）的核心挑战，探索时间信息编码的实际机制。

Method: 通过移除或修改PEs、反转帧序列等实验，分析时间信息的整合路径，并提出跨模态注意力分阶段和早期令牌截断的退出机制。

Result: 发现时间信息主要通过帧间注意力机制编码，而非PEs；提出的两种策略在基准测试中表现有效。

Conclusion: 时间推理源于视觉令牌间的交互，为未来模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不适用于实时监测，而车载摄像头数据未被充分利用。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频流中生成准确的空间和结构数据。

Result: 深度校正模型表现优异（R2 = 0.92），地理定位误差平均为2.83米，高度估计误差为2.09米（树木）和0.88米（杆状物）。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了一种快速、实时且经济高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种基于文本驱动的3D编辑框架，通过引入对应约束注意力机制和多视图语义相似性，解决了现有方法在多视图一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动的3D编辑中难以保持多视图一致性，导致编辑效果模糊且不充分。

Method: CoreEditor采用对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性，实现多视图一致性编辑，并提供选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效提升了文本驱动3D编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

*Niki Foteinopoulou,Ignas Budvytis,Stephan Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为实现高效组合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时表现不佳，尤其是在开放环境中。

Method: 利用空间感知权重矩阵和动态模块选择，结合分类器自由引导改进。

Result: ClipScore提升1.3%，GPT-4V胜率72.43%，适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上测试GPT-5和GPT-4o，评估BI-RADS分级、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。具体表现为：EMBED数据集上密度分类56.8%，恶性分类52.8%；InBreast数据集上BI-RADS准确率36.9%；CMMD数据集上恶性分类准确率55.0%；CBIS-DDSM数据集上BI-RADS准确率69.3%。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光任务中显示出潜力，但需领域适应和优化才能满足临床应用需求，GPT-5的性能提升趋势表明通用大语言模型在乳腺X光视觉问答中的前景。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

TL;DR: Thyme提出了一种新范式，通过生成和执行代码来增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的图像处理和逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理功能上不如专有模型丰富，Thyme旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先通过SFT训练代码生成能力，再通过RL优化决策，并提出GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理探索与代码执行精度。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成和执行实现了图像处理与推理能力的结合，为MLLMs提供了更高的自主性和性能。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.
