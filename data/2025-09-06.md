TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了大语言模型在疾病检测中的各种适配策略，发现类质心示例、推理提示和粒度微调等方法能显著提高识别性病的性能，适配后的开源模型可以达到或超越商业系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查方法可以提供可扩展的检测方案。需要研究大语言模型的适配策略在识别性病施中的效果。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，比较9个仅文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。测试了上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态整合等适配策略。

Result: 类质心示例在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示对小模型有显著改善，粒度微调通常获得最高分。添加分类头能大幅提升表现较差模型的性能。多模态模型表现良好但未超过最佳文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和微调方法）对语音基础的性病检测至关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超过商业系统的效果。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成方法和强化学习来提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本大语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态变化的用户语音时。

Method: 使用强大的教师LLM通过自合成方法生成高质量对齐数据，然后采用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，无需人工监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，优于传统的蒸馏基线，并在口语问答和语音转文本翻译任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够仅使用自生成数据就显著提升SpeechLMs的性能，且可无缝扩展到多种语音处理任务，为解决模态差异问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图表和文本视图，实现信息丰富的定性和定量分析

Method: 采用4位量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，第一层生成图表和文本摘要及情感分数，高层进行层次堆叠整合

Result: 微调后的Mistral 7B模型能够有效进行加密货币新闻的多层次分析，提供重要见解，知识图谱表示能基本消除大语言模型的幻觉问题

Conclusion: 该方法展示了使用微调Mistral 7B模型进行多层次加密货币新闻分析的可行性，能够提供信息丰富的分析结果

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个基于LLM构建的意大利立法过程事件日志数据集（1987-2022年），用于推动法律领域的过程挖掘研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据可获取性和质量，需要高质量的法律过程数据集

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站提取非结构化数据，使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程事件日志

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，包含1987-2022年意大利立法过程的完整事件日志，并进行了初步分析验证

Conclusion: ProLiFIC可作为法律过程挖掘的基准数据集，促进过程挖掘与大型语言模型的结合，推动该领域的新发展

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过将营收报告会编码为层次话语树来生成语义丰富且结构意识的嵌入表示。该方法结合了文本、音频、视频的情感信号以及话语元数据，通过两阶段转换器架构实现节点级和全局嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法捐描营收报告会这种半结构化财务沟通的层次化话语结构。

Method: 提出一种两阶段转换器架构：第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级利用文本、音频、视频情感信号以及话语元数据编码多模态内容；第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入。每个节点包含独白或问答对，并丰富包括情感信号、连贯性分数、主题标签和回答覆盖率等结构化元数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，所生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义丰富的表征，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在财务报告领域具有实用价值，还能扩展到其他高风险即兴沟通领域，如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，提供了一种健壮且可解释的多模态话语表征方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于转换器模型的Early-SIB方法，通过分析青少年在论坛的发帖和互动，在其明确表达自杀念头前预测自杀意念和行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏精神健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体为实时分析青少年的想法和困扰提供了机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，序列处理用户在论坛的发帖和互动内容，在用户明确表达自杀念头前预测其是否会发帖自杀意念和行为(SIB)内容

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据集上，模型实现了0.73的平衡准确率，证明该方法可以有效预测未来的自杀意念和行为

Conclusion: 这种不依赖自我曝露内容的预测框架在自杀预测领域很少被研究，Early-SIB模型可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为青少年自杀防治提供新的技术手段

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种使用线性探针训练的实体级幻觉检测方法，能够在长文本生成中实时识别假造的名称、日期等实体，在多个模型上都超过基线方法的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗、法律等高风险应用中幻觉问题可能造成严重害害，而现有检测方法或者受限于短事实查询，或者需要昂贵的外部验证

Method: 开发了一种注释方法，利用网络搜索来标注模型响应中的基础标签，指明哪些标记对应假造实体。这个数据集使得能够使用简单高效的线性探针方法训练有效的幻觉分类器

Result: 在四个模型家族中，该分类器在长文本响应中一贵超过基线方法（如语义熵AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），在短形式问答中也有改善。虽然只训练了实体级标签，但在数学推理任务中也能有效检测错误答案

Conclusion: 这是一种有前景的新方法，能够实现可扩展的、实际应用的幻觉检测，并且一个模型的注释数据可以重用于其他模型的训练

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈理论改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于空间聚类优化，而非信息理论分析，存在与下游任务脱节的问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发UDIB算法，用计算高效上界替代KL散度，实现熵正则化的鲁棒K-means聚类

Result: UDIB生成共享主题表示，不仅在空间上一致，而且在信息理论层面最大化提示-响应的关系信息

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供更优基础，是检测LLM幻觉的新型敏感工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR²框架通过对抗强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，教师模型将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，学生模型学习提取底层计算逻辑，显著提升模型在未知编程任务上的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，忽视了抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键能力

Method: 提出AR²对抗强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述而不改变基本逻辑，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性回答能力，结合内部知识提取和外部知识检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的限制，现有RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，限制了组合推理和事实不一致性检测能力

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图：通过prompt从问题提取种子KG，迭代使用LLM潜在知识扩展，通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse框架有效解决了多文档科学推理任务，提供了结构化分析和可视化工具，并发布了基准数据集ResearchPulse-Bench。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR在边缘部署环境中表现最优，传统OCR系统在计算效率、延迟和成本方面优于大型视觉语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声、多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，评估传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型在边缘部署环境中的性能差异

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上比较5种先进LVLM和2种传统OCR系统，评估准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等多个指标

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均0.17秒/图像)，成本仅为0.006美元/1000图像

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是比大型语言模型更优的选择

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身输出而非其他模型输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调优和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 构建区分合理和不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时应用这些向量而不需要重新训练模型。

Result: 导向向量能将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示方法和直接偏好优化基线，但在合理自我偏好和无偏同意场景下表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 导向向量作为LLM作为评判者的保障措施既有前景也有局限性，自我偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更鲁棒的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念共现模式和语义向量的关系，探索了临床文档中概念关联性，证实了语义表征在提高文档完整性和发现潜在临床关系中的价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙事，但非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战。需要探索SNOMED CT标准化术语中概念共现模式与语义相似性的关系

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量模型(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析SNOMED CT概念共现模式与语义相似性的关系，分析其在不同专业和时间段的变化

Result: 共现模式与语义相似性呈弱相关，但向量模型能抓取临床意义关联；向量建议的概念经常与后期文档匹配；概念聚类形成了一质性临床主题；共现模式与死亡率、再入院等结果相关

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量具有补充价值，能够提高文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系，为决策支持和表型分析应用提供信息

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于度量学习的少样本学习方法MLSD，用于跨目标和跨领域的立场检测，通过三元组损失构建判别性嵌入空间来提升领域适应能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨不同目标和领域的立场检测任务中，模型难以适应新目标领域的问题，需要一种能够有效捕获语义相似性和差异性的方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来构建判别性嵌入空间，捕获不同立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异性，从而增强领域适应能力

Result: 在两个数据集上的多个跨目标和跨领域场景中评估，相比六个广泛使用的立场检测模型，MLSD在立场检测性能上取得了统计显著的提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨目标和跨领域立场检测的性能，证明了构建判别性嵌入空间对于领域适应的重要性

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，解决了传统回译评估方法的局限性，在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法（将生成的手语识别回文本再比较），这种方法存在两个问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律）；2）难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种新颖的基于语义感知嵌入的评估指标，在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，能够处理语义和韵律变化。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore实现了近乎完美的正确与随机对区分（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore为手语生成评估提供了更准确和鲁棒的方法，解决了传统回译评估的模糊性问题，并展示了跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标套装，用于系统评估视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上与人类存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型评测主要集中在单轮或问答场景，而真实的基础设置是一个交互过程，需要逐步形成共享理解。

Method: 研究者开发了四个评估指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似度），在150个自我对战会话中测试了三款专有VLMs，并与人类对比。

Result: 三款模型都在至少三个指标上与人类模式分离，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现任务成功并不表示成功基础，高图像-语句对齐也不能预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套装和发现为未来VLM基础设置研究提供了框架，强调了需要更全面的评估方法来量化模型的真实交互能力。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估解决传统句子级评估的局限性，与人工评估高度相关，并能用于训练更好的翻译模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了传统的逐句对齐评估方法，需要新的评估框架来处理遗漏和多对一/一对多映射问题。

Method: Align-then-Slide框架包含两个阶段：1)Align阶段自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标文本；2)n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算1-4个chunk的平均指标分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致；生成的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型，产生优于普通SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、鲁棒且可操作的评估工具，验证了其在评估和改进翻译质量方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NE-PADD方法，通过命名实体识别和注意力机制改进部分音频深度伪造检测，在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上优于现有基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频深度伪造检测只在句子级别，而部分音频伪造检测需要帧级定位。现有方法在利用音频语义信息（特别是命名实体）方面探索不足

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)机制，使用辅助损失引导

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 证明了在部分音频深度伪造检测中整合命名实体知识的有效性

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面看似无意义但蕴含深层含义的表达。研究发现当前大语言模型在处理这类文本时存在明显局限，无法理解其多层次语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在处理具有深层含义但表面看似无意义的语言表达时的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了一个包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言Drivelology示例数据集，通过专家评审和多轮讨论进行标注，并评估了多种大语言模型在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示大语言模型存在明显局限性：经常混淆Drivelology与浅层无意义内容，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了大语言模型在语用理解方面存在深层的表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解。研究发布了数据集和代码以促进对超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模的进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT推理提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务上的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍不足。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，对每个可信度维度进行结构化概述和方法论分析。

Result: 研究发现推理技术通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更大的漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调了在推进推理技术的同时需要关注其安全风险。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探测的LLM安全检测方法，发现这些方法学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性，存在虚假安全感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全担忧，现有基于探测的方法在分布外性能表现不佳，需要重新评估这种范式的有效性

Method: 通过控制实验系统分析：比较简单n-gram方法性能、使用语义清理数据集进行控制实验、详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探测方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非真正的语义有害性，揭示了当前方法的局限性

Conclusion: 基于探测的方法存在虚假安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，推动负责任的安全研究方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG三个组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：过度依赖LLM理解能力、缺乏外部环境交互、缺少记忆能力。在更复杂的MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中，性能比现有最佳方法提升10.3%，且操作步骤更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的移动代理存在三个主要问题：1）过度依赖LLM的理解能力，容易产生误操作或遗漏步骤；2）缺乏与外部环境的交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务就会终止；3）缺乏记忆能力，每次指令都需要重新构建界面，无法从之前的错误中学习。

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG增强组件：InterRAG（用于快速准确识别用户查询）、LocalRAG（处理复杂长序列移动任务）、MemRAG（提供记忆能力）。并构建了更具挑战性的MobileRAG-Eval基准测试。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试上的大量实验结果表明，MobileRAG能够轻松处理现实世界的移动任务，相比最先进方法性能提升10.3%，且使用更少的操作步骤。

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了当前移动代理的三大局限性，显著提升了移动任务处理的准确性和效率，为现实世界移动应用的自动化提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Method: 提出矩阵思维（MoT）结构，通过“列-单元通信”机制在水平和垂直两个维度探索问题，构建矩阵知识单元进行事实纠正

Conclusion: MoT结构能够有效提升LLM的推理能力，通过矩阵化思维减少冗余并实现深度推理，为复杂问题回答提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Motivation: 解决韩语诗歌情感分析研究不足的问题，克服诗歌比喻语言和文化特异性的挑战，填补计算方法和文学分析之间的空白

Method: 构建多标签情感数据集（7,007行级条目+615作品级条目），采用最先进的韩语语言模型进行序列微调（先通用语料后KPoEM数据集）

Result: 微调后的模型F1-micro达到0.60，相比通用语料训练的模型（0.34）性能显著提升，能够准确识别时空和文化特定的情感表达

Conclusion: KPoEM数据集为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能，成功保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别，架起了计算方法和文学分析的桥梁

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。代码已公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证式迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证式迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过创新的验证式迭代微调和错误驱动机制，有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估语音角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流水线：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型系统地为每个角色构建多维度的角色档案，从而创建包含13335个多轮对话的VoxRole基准。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的各自优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演对话代理领域标准化评估基准的空白，为未来研究提供了重要的评估工具和数据集资源。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CANDY是一个评估大语言模型在中文虚假信息事实核查方面能力的基准测试，包含约2万个标注实例。研究发现当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，但作为辅助工具具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在事实核查中的应用日益增多，但其在核查虚假信息方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统评估其在中文环境下的能力和局限性。

Method: 构建了CANDY基准测试，包含约2万个精心标注的中文虚假信息实例，使用思维链推理和少样本提示等技术增强LLMs，并开发分类法分析错误解释。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面表现有限，即使使用增强技术。最常见的失败模式是事实捏造。LLMs单独使用时不可靠，但作为辅助工具能显著提升人类表现。

Conclusion: 大语言模型单独用于事实核查不可靠，但在作为人类辅助工具时具有巨大潜力。CANDY数据集和代码已开源，为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极低资源语言（如Ladin语）因缺乏标注数据而导致大语言模型效果差的问题，为缘危语言提供NLP基础资源。

Method: 利用少量并行Ladin-意大利语句子对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据创建合成数据集，并采用严格过滤和反向翻译程序确保语言质量。

Result: 经验证，将合成数据集整合到机器翻译训练中可以大幅提高意大利语-Ladin语翻译的性能，超越现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 成功为Ladin语创建了首批公开NLP数据集，为该缘危语言的NLP研究和应用奠定了基础，提供了可扩展的技术方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

TL;DR: RTQA是一种无需训练的时态知识图问答框架，通过递归分解问题、底向上解决子问题和多路径答案聚合，显著提升了复杂时态查询的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时态知识图问答方法主要关注隐式时态约束，缺乏处理复杂时态查询的能力，分解框架中遇到推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA框架包含三个核心组件：时态问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。采用递归思维方式，将问题递归分解为子问题，使用大语言模型和知识图知识底向上求解，并通过多路径答案聚合提高故障容锐性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA指标数据集上进行实验，在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别中实现了显著的Hits@1提升，超过了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了现有旹态知识图问答方法的限制，通过递归分解和多路径聚合提升了复杂时态查询的处理能力和故障容锐性，且无需训练。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了大语言模型对重写问题的稳健性，发现LLM在语言变化中表现显著下降，对标准测试的可靠性提出质疑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中存在语言变化，需要模型在不同表达方式下保持效果，而标准测试仅使用固定格式的问题

Method: 系统性生成6个常见测试集中所有问题的各种重写版本，并测量34个先进LLM在这些重写输入下的效果变化

Result: 虽然LLM排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降，模型在语言变化中表现弱势

Conclusion: 标准测试评估可能无法全面反映模型在实际部署中的稳健性，需要开发更具稳健性的测试集

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统功能语法和Cardiff语法在中文文本分析中缺乏自动化注释工具，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型，使用4100条人民日报叵子进行功能语法注释建立数据集，通过细调模型实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 模型在测试集上获得0.852的F1值，显著超过其他对比模型，在识别主语、主动词、补语等核心语法元素方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将功能语法与注意力模型相结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了隐含叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强的方法提升了NLP系统在复杂文本分析中的性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 词汇对齐能提升沟通效果，但在会话机器人中应用不足。需要为大语言模型发展基础的词汇对齐策略。

Method: 通过变更语音转写数据量和不同词性的词汇项目数，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估模型性能。

Result: 小型简洁模型表现最佳：10分钟语音数据，形容词和连词各5个项目，副词、名词、代词、动词各10个项目。这种组合在性能和数据效率上取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用方法，考虑了最小数据需求，为会话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了联合建模实体特征和话语关系特征的方法，实验表明整合两种特征能显著提升连贯性评估模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多单独关注实体特征或话语关系特征，很少将两者结合，但语言学中连贯性需要同时通过实体指称一致性和话语关系来达成。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，同时整合实体特征和话语关系特征显著提高了连贯性模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能够有效提升连贯性判断的准确性。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于生成合成心理咨询会话，通过分解咨询师响应生成任务到专门化的LLM智能体，显著提升了生成会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门建模关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理。同时提出了统一的评估框架，整合多种自动和专家指标，将专家评估从4个方面扩展到9个方面。

Result: MAGneT在生成会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐性方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT生成会话微调的模型性能更好，平均提升一般咨询技能6.3%、CBT特定技能7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架有效解决了高质量心理咨询数据稀缺的问题，通过多智能体方法更好地模拟真实咨询过程，为心理LLM的微调提供了高质量合成数据，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的双重增强框架，结合显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来提升数据多样性和模型鲁棒性，在两个Twitter数据集上F1分数分别提升17.67%和15.57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出双重增强框架：显式增强使用大语言模型通过5种生成策略增强文本信息；隐式增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术在特征空间操作结构融合嵌入，保持语义和关系属性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架通过双重增强有效提升了社交媒体事件检测的性能，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在监督微调后存在认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估模型的反直觉能力

Method: 构建包含8类对抗性挑战的数据集，使用人机协作流程创建高质量问题，采用优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉指令遵循方面存在明显不足，验证了该基准的必要性

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实准确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，该基准可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型在医疗领域使用时的短板问题，创建了两个新的问答数据集，发现所有模型都存在依赖过时知识的问题，并提出了解决方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别大语言模型在医疗领域应用中的风险，特别是因为医学建议会随新研究而不断发展，而LLM依赖静态训练数据导致可能提供有害或过时的医疗建议。

Method: 创建了两个新的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖普通生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，涵盖医学共识发生变化的情况），并对八个突出的LLM进行评估。

Result: 所有模型都一致地依赖过时知识，并分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这一现象的影响。

Conclusion: 识别了LLM在医疗领域使用的关键问题，为开发更新、更可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了减轻这一问题的未来方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO是一种改进的上下文ASR方法，通过音素增强编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了特定领域命名实体（特别是同音词）的识别准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体（尤其是同音词）时表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和将实体视为独立标记的处理方式，无法捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多标记偏置

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并减少不确定性下的误报

Result: 在1000个干扰项下，PARCO在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER，显著优于基线方法，并在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健的性能提升

Conclusion: PARCO通过综合的音素增强和实体消歧方法，有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，特别是在处理同音词和多标记实体方面表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了提示词对LLM性别偏见评估的影响，发现即使微小的提示变化也能对测量结果产生显著影响，甚至完全反转偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响力领域的应用增多，性别偏见问题引起越来越多关注。当前的评估方法通常依赖于经过精心构造的提示，这些提示可能显或隐地信号出性别偏见相关内容。

Method: 在两种提示条件下测试模型：(1)使测试上下文显著，(2)使性别相关内容显著。使用四种任务格式，采用令牌概率和离散选择两种指标进行评估。

Result: 发现即使微小的提示变化也能对偏见测量结果产生显著影响，甚至完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标通常比概率指标更能放大偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅强调了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新的谜题：经过良好控制的测试设计在何种程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力上的表现，发现即使日语主导模型也在历法运算和多历法一致性方面遇到困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析和改善了语言模型的时间推理能力，但大多数研究只关注公历，而很多非公历系统如日本历、希吉来历和希伯来历等仍在活跃使用且反映了文化根基的时间概念

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语主导和日语主导的开源语言模型进行系统性评估

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使日语主导模型也在日本历算术和保持不同历法之间的一致性方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好地处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能，训练速度提升6.2倍

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测有效提升了骨枱动作识别的效率和性能

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 统一的分割基础检测和分类框架能够有效提高有穴分裂分析的健壮性和准确性

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决多偏差问题，提高模型鲁棒性和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型性能，单独处理一种偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习(ABIL)：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器识别偏差；2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有偏差的紧凑网络

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，在SBA指标上创下新低

Conclusion: GMBM是首个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案，能够有效处理偏差复杂性和分布偏移问题

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统性的缩减研究，开发了一种轻量级U-Net模型，在保持与nnU-Net等效性能的同时，将参数量减少33倍，速度提升4倍，适合实时心臀超声分割应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心臀超声分割中表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用。需要开发更轻量、更快速的模型来支持自动化临床测量提取。

Method: 进行系统性的缩减研究，逐步评估数据增帽方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术的效果，识别最有效的nnU-Net组件。

Result: 开发出仅有2M参数的轻量级U-Net，在CAMUS数据集(N=500)上达到与nnU-Net(33M参数)统计学等效的性能：LV/MYO/LA Dice分数分别为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89(p>0.05)，模垅缩小16倍，速度提升4倍(1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧)。跨数据集验证显示具有相似的普适性。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是驱动性能的关键因素，而复杂增帽和大模型容量带来逐步减少的回报。通过有针对性的模型简化，可以在保持分割准确性的同时实现显著的计算效率提升，为实时心臀超声分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Conclusion: QuantV2X证明了完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中的可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构来捕捉空间关系，图比较在搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用中至关重要。现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为最终学习到的节点级嵌入的距离函数

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图匹配解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值，实现领域适应，仅需0.04%的参数就能达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应视觉语言模型到新的细粒度领域存在困难，现有方法依赖提示工程和额外组件，可能限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类结果，在few-shot设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效且可解释的CLIP适应方法，在保持预训练模型的同时显著提升领域适应性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了STA-Net模型，通过形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)和训练免费的神经网络架构搜索方法，解决了边缘设备上植物病害诊断模型的挑战，在CCMT数据集上达到了89.00%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 围绕全球食品安全需求，精准农业和植物病害诊断变得至关重要。然而，将高精度模型部署到边缘设备上面临挑战，常见的轻量级网络使用通用对象识别的注意机制，无法有效捐捕不规则病变形状和复杂纹理等细微病理特征。

Method: 提出两部分解决方案：首先使用训练免费的神经网络架构搜索方法(DeepMAD)为边缘设备构建高效网络背景；其次提出形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，将注意力分为两个分支：一个使用可变形卷积(DCNv4)实现形状感知，另一个使用Gabor滤波器实现纹理感知。

Result: 在公开的CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型(仅包401K参数和51.1M FLOPs)达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融实验确认STAM在基线模型和标准注意力模型上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制集成领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重阻碍。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块和Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)，通过增强多尺度特征表示和生成富含全局语义信息的位置图来指导Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder(MSSD)进行更准确的预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验证实SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并展示了其对更广泛COD任务的高度泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为水下伪装目标检测领域提供了首个基准数据集和有效框架，解决了水下环境中的特殊挑战，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

Motivation: 传统图像滿散模型仅使用独立采样的静态图像进行训练，这种方式在捐损了时间序列信息，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和治理化能力下降

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善滿散训练，无需任何网络结构修改，可无缝集成到标准滿散训练流程

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，方法将收敛速度提高2倍以上，在训练和验证分布上都获得更低的FID指标，同时提高了生成的多样性，能够更好地捐损有意义的时间变化

Conclusion: 通过引入时间序列信息，滿散模型的训练效果可以显著提升，优化分析显示该正则化方法能够降低梯度方差，从而促进更快的收敛

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐解决放射诊断中的漏读错误和报告变异性问题，在多个任务上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（漏读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中需要检查数百个切片的情况下。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射学分析中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了更可靠的诊断支持系统。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在细粒度数据集上表现有限，无法有效捕捉不同细粒度类别间的细微差异。

Method: 提出两个模块：1）属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为共享属性和特定属性；2）粒度学习模块通过因果推理策略整合属性构建视觉粒度。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL方法能够学习更具区分性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP模型在细粒度识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: 这一研究证明了在气流漩浪减弱任务中引入事件模态的重要效益价值，为高效漩浪减弱提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理低信息区域时存在计算冗余问题，固定阈值或数量的token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度的样本，导致性能不佳

Method: 提出Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景变化来自适应丢弃各模态中的低信息区域；设计Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF)模块来有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合策略，成功解决了多模态检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了更好的性能平衡

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models
examined in this survey is available in Our Repository

TL;DR: OccTENS是一个生成式占用世界模型，通过时间多尺度预测任务和TensFormer架构，解决了现有方法在效率、长期生成质量和可控性方面的不足，实现了高效可控的高质量3D场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在3D占用场景生成中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新表述为时间多尺度预测任务，使用TensFormer架构管理时间因果性和空间关系，并提出了统一序列建模的整体姿态聚合策略。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面都优于最先进的方法，实现了更高的生成质量和更快的推理速度。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间多尺度预测框架和TensFormer架构，成功解决了3D占用场景生成中的关键挑战，为可控高效的长期3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

TL;DR: 通过视觉-语言模型为多视图图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习来学习功能对应关系，以支持跨类别的密集对应分析任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨不同类别的对象之间建立密集对应关系时，对象的功能可以指导对应关系的确立，因为支持特定功能的部件通常具有相似的形状和外观。

Method: 提出了弱监督学习范式：利用视觉-语言模型为多视图图像伪标注功能部件，然后结合密集对比学习来将功能和空间知识精炼到新模型中。还构建了合成和真实的评估数据集作为任务基准。

Result: 结果表明该方法在密集功能对应任务上优于现有的自监督学习图像表征和基于视觉-语言模型的基线方案。

Conclusion: 通过利用功能信息来指导跨类别对象间的密集对应关系确立是有效的，提出的弱监督学习方法能够成功地组合功能和空间知识，为该任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attn-Adapter是一种新颖的在线少样本学习框架，通过双注意力机制增强CLIP的适应性，无需重新训练基础模型即可实现动态适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别方面表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临挑战，因为使用提示学习的离线微调计算密集且容易过拟合

Method: 提出包含两个组件的双注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter使用支持样本细化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter通过整合局部和全局特征来丰富图像嵌入

Result: Attn-Adapter在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在CLIP骨干网络上具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了少样本学习中的过拟合和计算效率问题，为视觉语言模型的实际应用提供了有效的在线适应方案

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM-based指标虽然相关性强但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代评估

Method: SPECS基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性 - 正确奖励细节准确性，错误惩罚不准确描述，专门针对长图像描述任务优化

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，为图像描述模型开发提供了实用的迭代评估替代方案

Conclusion: SPECS是一个高效且有效的长图像描述评估指标，在保持高质量评估的同时解决了现有方法的计算成本问题，适合在模型开发过程中使用

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: ChexGen是一个生成式视觉-语言基础模型，通过统一的文本、掩码和边界框引导框架合成胸部X光片，解决了医疗图像标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域缺乏高质量标注的多样化医学图像数据，这阻碍了可靠AI模型的开发。虽然自然图像的生成基础模型已有重大技术进展，但医学图像生成仍面临挑战。

Method: 基于潜在扩散变换器架构，在迄今为止最大的胸部X射线数据集（96万张X光片-报告对）上进行预训练，开发了统一的文本、掩码和边界框引导合成框架。

Result: 通过专家评估和定量指标验证了准确的X光片合成能力；在数据增强和监督预训练中表现出色，使用少量训练数据就能在疾病分类、检测和分割任务上提升性能；能够创建多样化患者队列，通过检测和缓解人口统计偏差来增强模型公平性。

Conclusion: 生成式基础模型在构建更准确、数据高效和公平的医疗AI系统中具有变革性作用，ChexGen为此提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端学习的多视角视频编码框架，通过利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来增强依赖视角的压缩效率，显著优于传统MV-HEVC标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体视频的关键数据源，但数据量巨大导致存储和传输挑战。现有深度学习视频编码方法主要关注单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足。

Method: 提出特征级视角间运动矢量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征来条件化依赖视角运动编码；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文；配合相应的视角间熵模型学习先验信息。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了随机访问和向后兼容性，同时提升了压缩效率，为多视角视频编码领域提供了有效的端到端学习解决方案。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑精炼的新框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局保持或在推理时纠正几何错误。

Method: TopoSculpt采用：(i)整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；(ii)首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；(iii)使用持久同调的课程精炼方案，从粗到细逐步纠正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上的实验显示显著改进：β₀错误从69.00降至3.40（气道）和从1.65降至0.30（CoW），树长度检测和分支检测率提高近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑方面都有实质性改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Motivation: 气胸在胸腔内异常积气可能危及生命，胸部X光是首选诊断工具，但小型气胸病例可能表现细微，需要自动化检测方法辅助放射科医生。

Method: 使用U-Net架构配合EfficientNet-B4编码器，在SIIM-ACR数据集上进行训练，采用数据增强技术和二元交叉熵加Dice损失的组合损失函数。

Result: 在独立PTX-498测试集上取得了IoU 0.7008和Dice分数0.8241的优秀性能表现。

Conclusion: 该模型能够准确定位气胸区域，为放射科医生提供有效的辅助诊断支持，证明了深度学习在气胸自动检测中的实用价值。

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力来增强OOD检测，通过生成表达性负句子来精确描述OOD分布，显著降低FPR95达4.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假阴性标签会显著降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能为OOD样本的图像并生成表达性负句子；对于近OOD设置，识别与负图像视觉相似的ID类别子集，生成定制化的视觉相似负标签；设计自适应加权分数来平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95达4.2%，建立了新的最先进水平；方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的理解和推理能力有效解决了OOD检测中的负空间构建问题，在近OOD和远OOD设置下都表现出色，且具有很好的适应性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖单一图像模态，限制了特征表示能力、变化模式建模和泛化性能，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MMChange方法：1）图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕捉细粒度语义变化；4）图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的广泛实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态遥感变化检测的有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间关系编码和实例相关性分析的问题，特别是处理训练和测试序列长度不同的外推问题，同时避免Transformer方法对定制CUDA内核的依赖

Method: 包含位置编码模块（利用实例坐标而非索引编码空间关系）和SAC块（基于MLP的全实例相关性分析，线性时间复杂度），MLP结构简单易于部署

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过空间感知的位置编码和高效的MLP-based相关性分析，为WSI分类提供了高性能且易于部署的解决方案

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但难以处理复杂表述；提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示词设计原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting

TL;DR: 提出SliceSemOcc框架，通过垂直切片和3D通道注意力机制改进3D语义占据预测，在高度维度上更好地处理特征，显著提升小物体检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了不同高度特征的表征能力

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文信息，提出SEAttention3D模块为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上显著提升平均IoU，特别是在大多数小物体类别上获得明显增益

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过垂直切片和高度感知的注意力机制有效解决了3D语义占据预测中高度信息处理不足的问题，提升了整体性能

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在路径图像分割、政治投票预测等应用中，包级标签通常是包内实例的多数类别，需要从多数标签学习实例级分类模型。

Method: 提出计数网络来估计包内各类实例数量以获取多数标签，并设计多数比优化模块(MPEM)来移除少数类实例提高学习效果。

Result: 在4个数据集上试验表明方法优于传统MIL方法，分离实验确认了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的多类MIL问题，提出的方法能够有效地从多数标签学习实例级分类模型。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Conclusion: 该无需模型微调或额外标注的重排名方法能够通过多视角特征有效减少视角偏差，在各大数据集上均取得显著成效，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：一是将噪声段级伪标签视为可靠监督，二是让无差别注意力将错误传播到所有帧，导致训练过程中初始错误被反复放大

Method: 结合双向文本融合(BiT)模块和类别感知时序图(CATS)模块。BiT模块进行语义注入和动态校准来定位和净化语义线索，CATS模块进行语义传播和连接以实现精确的语义信息传播

Result: 在两个基准数据集LLP和UnAV-100的多个关键指标上达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过整合两种研究方向的优势并互补，成功解决了音频-视觉视频解析中的错误放大问题，实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance

ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset

Motivation: 现有方法在角色一致性方面存在困难，导致伪影生成和对话渲染不准确，造成故事叙述不连贯。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的角色一致性和对话准确性问题，为连贯的故事叙述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but

diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提高了图像标注效率，支持多种导出格式和离线操作，是一个高效且易用的图像标注解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像层面进行跨域特征对齐，但对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠，导致难以克服域间差异。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域差异问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: 混合DMP架构能够有效利用多尺度形状信息，在遥感图像语义分割任务中实现性能提升，为解决遥感图像特有的挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该自监督框架为从极稀疏视图和无相机监督的数据中学习关节对象表示提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著降低了输入要求

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估方法存在数据泄露问题（模型在测试数据上预训练）和评估指标不足（仅依赖精确坐标，忽略推理过程且存在隐私问题）。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来评估模型输出与人类期望的匹配程度。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和以人为中心的基准测试平台，能够更准确地评估大型视觉语言模型的实际地理定位能力。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，在不大规模增加训练数据的情况下实现了卓越性能

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，通过多实例学习和对比学习优化，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes

impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了ASE-MLLM框架，首次将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中，专门用于美学图像描述生成任务，在主流基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有美学图像描述研究主要依赖微调方法，未能专门让多模态大语言模型关注目标美学内容，需要一种能够显式整合美学显著性的方法。

Method: 提出端到端的ASE-MLLM框架，包含图像美学显著性模块(IASM)高效提取美学显著性特征，设计IAS-ViT图像编码器通过交叉注意力机制融合美学显著性特征和原始图像特征。

Result: 在主流美学图像描述基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用多模态大语言模型，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务整合图像美学显著性的多模态大语言模型框架，有效提升了美学描述生成能力。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练2D扩散模型的3D风格迁移新方法，通过跨视角风格对齐和实例级风格迁移，解决了现有方法在高级语义提取和结构清晰度方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格迁移方法难以有效提取和传递参考风格图像的高级语义，且风格化结果缺乏结构清晰度和分离性，导致难以区分3D场景中的不同实例或对象。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）利用扩散先验生成关键视角的风格化渲染；2）将风格化关键视图转移到3D表示。创新设计包括跨视角风格对齐（在UNet最后上采样块插入跨视角注意力）和实例级风格迁移。

Result: 在广泛的场景中（从正向面对到具有挑战性的360度环境），定性和定量实验表明该方法显著优于最先进的方法，实现了更具结构化、视觉连贯性和艺术丰富性的风格化效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合了预训练2D扩散模型的先验知识，通过创新的跨视角对齐和实例级迁移机制，有效解决了3D风格迁移中的语义提取和结构清晰度问题，为3D场景的艺术风格化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PtyINR框架，通过神经隐式表示同时解决X射线叠层成像中的物体和探针恢复问题，无需预标定探针，在低信号条件下表现出优异的重建质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线叠层成像在纳米尺度分辨率方面具有优势，但现有方法在探针未知时重建效果不佳，特别是在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 使用Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR)自监督框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续的神经表示，直接从原始衍射图样进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上都实现了卓越的重建质量，在具有挑战性的低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息驱动的框架，可解决探针依赖的逆问题，适用于广泛的计算显微镜问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

TL;DR: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching和Velocity Distillation两种优化目标，将25步采样减少到1-2步，实现9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高质量3D生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，虽然一致性模型在2D扩散加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching（速度匹配）和Velocity Distillation（速度蒸馏）两种优化目标，将边缘数据传输的优化目标从传输层面转换到速度和分布层面。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，在A800上实现0.68秒（1步×2）和0.94秒（2步×2）的延迟，分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为3D生成的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在肖像动画生成中难以实现高保真、空间一致的属性迁移，特别是零样本场景下的多属性组合问题

Method: 采用双参考网络将肖像和属性图像的空间特征注入扩散模型去噪过程；使用自重建训练策略；提出掩码扩展和空间/外观变换增强策略

Result: 在肖像动画属性迁移任务上达到最先进性能，能够有效泛化到多样属性和真实场景参考组合

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，成功实现了零样本的高质量肖像动画生成和多属性迁移

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测X光影像中的准直器阴影，虽然应用中一般仅有4个边缘，但方法本身不受特定边数的限制

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Conclusion: 论文讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放挑战和未来方向，为全景视觉技术的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态扭曲）对社会构成日益严重的威胁，现有方法通常只关注单一扭曲类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含问题感知视觉放大器模块来提取任务特定的视觉特征，并构建TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本）进行训练。

Result: 在领域内和零样本基准测试中，TRUST-VL实现了最先进的性能，同时表现出强大的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 联合训练不同扭曲类型有助于知识共享，增强模型的泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Result: VFR能够生成分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下同时保持局部平滑性和全局时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法是长视频虚拟试穿生成领域的首创工作，为资源和数据有限的长视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.
