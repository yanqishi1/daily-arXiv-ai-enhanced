### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，有效解决深度学习模型中的伪相关性问题，提升泛化能力和分布外鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，使用非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法来同时解决多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CoBA（CounterBias Augmentation）框架：1）将文本分解为主语-谓语-宾语三元组；2）选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性；3）从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关性带来的挑战，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个大规模德语数据集，包含毒性标注和年龄估计，揭示不同年龄段用户的网络毒性语言模式差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性语音数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人工标注和LLM标注（3,024条人工标注+30,024条LLM标注）

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年轻用户偏爱表达性语言，年长用户更多参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在现实应用中的认知偏差，特别是锚定效应对价格谈判可靠性的影响

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判，分析推理和人格因素与锚定效应的关系

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），但人格特质与敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM的认知偏差，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂任务上表现优异，但在基本视觉感知任务上的性能缺乏系统评估，需要测试模型对生成图像中基本形状和结构的感知能力

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLMs和LRMs上进行测试

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在问题复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同类别表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难

Conclusion: MLLMs在复杂任务上的优异表现不能代表其在基本视觉感知任务上的能力，需要更全面的评估框架来理解模型的真实感知能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个以数据为中心的Sci-LLMs发展框架，将科学大语言模型的发展重新定义为模型与其底层数据基质的共同进化，并提供了科学数据和知识表示的统一分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学大语言模型在科学研究中的知识表示、整合和应用方面正在发生变革，但其发展受到科学数据复杂性的制约。需要建立一个系统性的框架来理解Sci-LLMs与科学数据之间的协同进化关系。

Conclusion: 论文提出了向闭环系统的范式转变，其中基于Sci-LLMs的自主代理能够主动实验、验证并为不断演化的知识库做出贡献，为构建可信赖、持续演化的人工智能系统提供了路线图。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

### [8] [Quantifying Label-Induced Bias in Large Language Model Self- and Cross-Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21164)
*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在严重标签偏见：Claude标签总能提高评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，虚假标签可导致排名反转和50%的偏好投票变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签的影响，以确保评估的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种虚假标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分进行自评和交叉评估。

Result: 发现明显的评估不对称性：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数，虚假标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择最大化信息增益的问题，显著提升了多轮对话中的信息收集能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型在交互式环境中智能收集信息的能力，使其成为更有效的多轮对话代理。

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择期望信息增益最大的问题；使用LLM的信念分布构建概率模型；设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略。

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了原则性的信息收集框架，通过贝叶斯实验设计显著提升了模型在交互环境中的表现。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习精调Llama-3.1 8B模型，实现航空安全事故人因分析的自动化HFACS分类，精准度显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高航空安全分析的效率和准确性

Method: 采用基于GRPO强化学习策略精调Llama-3.1 8B语言模型，构建专门为航空安全分析设计的多组件奖励系统，并集成合成数据生成技术解决数据集类别不平衡问题

Result: 模型表现显著提升：精确匹配准确率从0.0400提升至0.1800（增长350%），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-flash等最先进模型

Conclusion: 证明了域优化的小型模型在关键安全分析中的优势，提出了多标签HFACS分类中精确匹配准确率作为评估语言模型推理能力的新标准，为资源受限设备的部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动导致的拼写攻击，性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表征替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，构建像素级生成语言模型

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了该方法对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 基于像素的表征方法能够有效提升语言模型对拼写攻击的抵抗力，同时扩展了对多语言文本的兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型在语音习得方面没有明显的关键期效应证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键期效应在人类语言习得中很重要，但之前的研究主要基于文本语言模型，而语音模型中的这些效应尚未充分探索，尽管口语在人类语言习得中起着核心作用。

Method: 在儿童导向语音上训练具有不同L2训练起始时间和L1训练终止时间的自监督语音模型，并评估其音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面没有表现出明显的关键期效应证据。延迟L2暴露起始的模型在L2上表现更好，延迟L1暴露终止会导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面不表现出人类语言习得中观察到的关键期效应模式。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在句子级生成上表现不佳或依赖领域知识，自一致性方法计算成本高，存在冗余

Method: 识别自一致性方法中的冗余（共享前缀标记），提出解码记忆管道(DMP)，包含选择性推理和退火解码

Result: 实验显示方法实现最高3倍加速，且AUROC性能不下降

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

### [17] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过'正常性'概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是正常/平均而非卓越的人类智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。同时指出图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官评估。结论认为ChatGPT等大语言模型难以通过图灵测试，因为它们追求的是卓越智能而非正常智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图灵测试的理论基础，探讨'正常性'概念在图灵测试中的核心作用，挑战当前AI发展追求卓越智能而非正常智能的范式。

Method: 通过概念分析和哲学论证，从统计学角度解读图灵测试中的'正常性'概念，包括测试目标的正常性和评估方式的统计性。

Result: 提出图灵测试本质上是测试正常智能而非卓越智能，需要机器表现出人类正常的错误行为；同时测试评估应基于多个法官的统计聚合判断。

Conclusion: 大语言模型难以通过图灵测试，因为它们追求人工智慧而非真正的人工智能；图灵测试能否贡献对人类认知的理解取决于人类心智是否可简化为正常心智，这超出了图灵测试本身的范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自动文本摘要评估中存在的可复现性挑战，研究旨在揭示不同评估指标在实际应用中的表现差异，特别是LLM基评估方法的可靠性问题。

Method: 基于SummEval数据集构建统一的开源评估框架，对六种代表性指标（从经典ROUGE到最新LLM基方法G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行系统性实验比较。

Result: 发现评估指标存在显著性能差异，与人类判断对齐度高的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性差；LLM基评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限可复现性等问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型作为自动评审生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，生成的评审内容也不会显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审能力上的具体表现和局限性，以避免对科学完整性造成风险。

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种ARG方法检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，通过对比正常论文和有逻辑缺陷论文的评审输出。

Result: 研究发现，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对ARGs生成的评审内容没有显著影响，表明当前自动评审生成器在检测逻辑一致性方面存在重大局限性。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来改进自动评审系统提供基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗多模态大语言模型在疾病诊断和临床决策中具有重要潜力，但需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应。现有基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的评估，缺乏对诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专门评估。

Method: 开发Med-RewardBench基准，采用三步严格流程构建高质量评估数据集，涵盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室的1026个专家标注案例，在6个临床关键维度上进行评估。评估了32个最先进的多模态大语言模型，并开发了通过微调实现性能提升的基线模型。

Result: 评估发现现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面面临重大挑战，开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗多模态大语言模型的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在医疗专业对齐方面的不足，并通过基线模型展示了改进潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，从大语言模型词嵌入中分解出可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法过于粗糙，忽略了细粒度的概念区分，需要更精细的语义子维度表示方法。

Method: 使用DCSRM模型将词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定语义信息，然后通过体素编码模型映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出了一组可解释的语义子维度，发现极性是驱动维度分解的关键因素，神经相关性验证了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了语义维度按照不同原则组织的结构特征，对理解语言和大脑中的意义组织具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [22] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出"意识形态深度"概念来衡量LLM内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操控性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现不同模型在意识形态深度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些倾向的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面层级的回应容易被提示工程操控，需要探究LLM是否具有连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量开源LLM的可操控性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征的分布和抽象程度。

Result: 发现可操控性较低的模型拥有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，其中一个模型比同等规模模型多7.3倍的政治特征。对核心政治特征进行针对性消融会导致深度模型产生一致、逻辑的推理转变，而浅层模型则增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLM可量化的属性，可操控性可作为窥探其潜在政治架构的重要窗口，不同模型在意识形态深度上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架提升7B参数小语言模型的中文问候语创意写作能力，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型创意写作能力强但计算成本高，小语言模型通过传统方法如SFT缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本昂贵，需要寻找更高效的创意写作增强方案。

Method: 使用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2) 基于对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则引导LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出，但原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，在减少人工标注依赖的同时保持了高质量的创意输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的自动分类器选择方法HierarchySelect，通过层次聚类和多样性优先策略来构建更有效的集成学习系统，用于假新闻检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法性能严重依赖分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是当模型倾向于学习冗余模式时。

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度的组。然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别，为每个级别选择一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性。最后选择最具多样性的池用于集成构建，并融入性能评估指标。

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，实验使用了40个异构分类器，涵盖不同应用领域和类别数量的数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的HierarchySelect方法能够有效选择多样化的分类器，提升集成学习系统在假新闻检测等任务中的性能。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity

across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect
privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization
techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered
on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of
Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers
and potent de-anonymization threats. The survey further explores
domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as
healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies
incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the
specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent
challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to
address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同演化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

*Peng Yu,En Xu,Bin Chen,Haibiao Chen,Yinfei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QZhou-Embedding是基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的通用文本嵌入模型，采用多任务框架和两阶段训练策略，在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量多样化数据提升检索模型性能。

Method: 使用统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略。采用数据合成管道（包括释义、增强和硬负例生成），以及两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Result: 在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中排名第一（2025年8月27日），同时在重排序、聚类等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 更高质量和多样化的数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM生成能力可以进一步优化嵌入模型的数据质量实现突破。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Misviz基准数据集，包含2,604个真实世界误导性可视化图表和81,814个合成图表，用于训练和评估AI模型检测误导性可视化图表的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化图表在社交媒体和网络上广泛传播错误信息，违反图表设计原则导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大规模、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 创建Misviz基准数据集（2,604个真实图表）和Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个图表），使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 检测误导性可视化图表的任务仍然极具挑战性，现有模型表现有限。

Conclusion: 发布Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表的研究提供重要资源，有助于保护读者和减少错误信息传播。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CPI-FT框架解决多任务微调中的跷跷板现象，通过核心参数隔离和融合技术，显著减轻任务干扰和遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在适应大语言模型时存在"跷跷板现象"，即某些任务的性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价，需要解决任务间的干扰和遗忘问题

Method: 1) 独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域；2) 基于区域重叠对任务分组；3) 核心参数直接移植，非核心参数通过SLERP融合；4) 冻结先前任务核心区域进行轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著优于传统的多任务和多阶段微调基线方法

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架有效缓解了多任务微调中的任务干扰和灾难性遗忘问题，为LLM的下游任务适配提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理需要深度文本分析的数值推理任务时表现不佳，特别是在训练数据和计算资源有限的情况下

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习

Result: MENTAT方法在三个RiR任务上相比冻结LLM和微调Transformer编码器基线提升了最高65%的性能

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在推理密集型回归任务上取得了显著改进，但该领域仍有很大的提升空间

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然评分来选择最佳推理链，在数学推理任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的关键挑战

Method: 使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在MATH500上提升10.18分，AIME2025上提升9.81分，在20个比较中16次以至少2倍少的样本超越基线

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠的技术支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调的预训练架构，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；VGG16在预训练模型中表现最佳（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

Motivation: 观察到大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战。

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细的空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力。

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，显著提升了零样本外观迁移的性能表现。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存累积误差的两个主要组件（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析、动态调整积分区间和闭式残差线性化等方法，在保持视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析阶段识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分区间；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似分析缓存引起的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上实现2倍加速，VBench指标退化最小。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统性地解决缓存误差问题，在保持基准保真度的同时显著提高效率，为扩散模型的高效推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该文章提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，解决视频大语言模型在细粒度时间语义理解上的挑战，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选，但当前视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和训练中缺乏跨帧推理监督，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义

Method: 提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务：(1)保留重点关键视频段落 (2)同步重构查询到最直接形式 (3)保持答案不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器集成到训练和推理流程中

Result: 提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提升0.47 F-1分数，查询重写性能竞争力强。经验验证结果显示TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%提升

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负荷分配和认知负荷，在训练时对齐查询与重点视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知段落聚焦和流程化查询表示，显示了时间信息筛选对改善视频-语言理解的有效性

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，且需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更灵活有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，将安全控制信号以补丁方式注入到锁定的T2I模型中，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他七种最先进的安全机制（约20%）。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，能够在保持图像质量的同时显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车于五个不同地理位置的城区进行的真实世界实验中，展现了优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV方法在处理复杂的目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在stuff-type目标、多目标和无目标场景下具有显著优势，验证了其在真实世界环境中的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够根据问题复杂度自适应决定是否思考的模型。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思考和非思考两种能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准测试上与更大的Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506(16B)模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算开销，为高效多模态推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的RGB、热成像和深度数据融合框架，用于在遮挡、伪装等恶劣条件下检测隐藏或部分隐藏物体，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来检测隐藏或部分隐藏物体。

Method: 提出HiddenObject融合框架，使用基于Mamba的融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕捉跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构可以显著推进多模态物体检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，解决了传统方法的空间信息丢失和域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT/X射线配准在图像引导导航中具有高精度和实时性要求，传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体辐射高斯重建模块，采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合3D重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动3D建筑生成算法的发展。

Method: 创建SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑，每个建筑提供三种模态：LoD 4语义3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了大规模、多样化、多模态的合成3D建筑数据集，为开发新型生成式AI算法提供了基础，能够自动化创建具有语义几何一致性的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为3D建筑生成研究提供了重要资源，支持开发基于预定义平面布局和屋顶几何的生成算法，推动建筑建模自动化发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变会影响单应性估计的准确性。传统方法分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：(i)单图像畸变、(ii)相同畸变、(iii)独立畸变。基于此方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了统一的解决方案，开发的求解器在速度和准确性方面均优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的概念表示方法来提高解释性。

Method: 采用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，使用注意力融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致问题，增强了概念定位能力并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在上下文中使用示例作为提示，使模型能够直接泛化到未见过的物体类别，无需参数调整或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练特定领域模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉对重识别至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负样本对推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM（如DINO）通过动态视觉提示提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个重识别基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务性能下降至DSC 0.33，表明小数据集下MRI序列差异对胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构），在91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI和50例T2加权MR-Linac病例上进行5折交叉验证，使用STAPLE集成方法，并聚焦解剖相关感兴趣区域。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）获得DSC 0.56、5mm DSC 0.73、HD95 41.1mm；任务2（T2加权MRI）性能下降，DSC 0.33、5mm DSC 0.50、HD95 20.1mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战，不同MRI序列引入的变异性影响性能，需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化到不同成像序列，因为图像对比度差异巨大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性，解决非线性逆问题；2）使用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在 vastly different 图像对比度和成像协议上实现高度准确的分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人体网格恢复方法追求通用性而忽略了个体差异，过度依赖2D约束导致3D精度下降。需要一种能够同时考虑个体体型特征和3D姿态合理性的方法。

Method: 开发了体型条件化的3D姿态先验（Point Diffusion Transformer），通过Point Distillation Sampling损失迭代指导姿态拟合。先校准用户体型，再进行个性化姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还显著改善了绝对姿态精度。方法数据效率高，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，为个性化3D人体重建提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Conclusion: HTP策略能够在保持传播模型高保真性能的前提下，大幅提升计算效率，为高效传播模型提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的人工分析耗时费力，需要更多样本来支持计算机视觉和机器学习方法的发展，但医学领域数据稀缺

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建了包含子宫内膜异位症区域注释的图像数据集GLENDA

Result: 成功发布了首个此类数据集，为子宫内膜异位症的计算机视觉分析提供了宝贵资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频的自动分析技术发展，支持治疗规划、病例文档和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用基于区域的完全卷积网络对腹腔镜妇科手术视频中的手术器械进行实例分割和识别，实现了较高的器械定位和分割精度，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容搜索的基础）由于特殊的视频内容仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用基于区域的完全卷积网络进行实例感知的（1）器械分割（区分器械或背景）和（2）器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍然是需要进一步研究的难题。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: 目前缺乏WSI内容识别的标准元数据，大规模集合中的手动检查效率低下，影响AI算法训练和验证的聚合组建。

Method: 提出通用框架生成2D索引地图，采用三层结构(来源、组织类型、病理变化)对WSI进行细粒度分析，使用统一语法语义实现不同目录间的互操性。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进衄了实验验证，通过具体案例展示了该标准在WSI目录、机器学习和图象表示中的优势和适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为WSI集合提供了详细的组织地图，有效解决了大规模数据集手动分析的挑战，推动了WSI在AI算法开发中的高效利用。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度伪标签的无监督增量学习方法ICPL，能够在无标注数据集上进行增量学习，性能接近有监督方法，在最终准确率上比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型能够增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法都假设增量数据集是完全标注的，这在实践中是不现实的。

Method: 使用基于置信度的伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制进行无监督增量学习。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，与有监督方法相比具有竞争力，比最先进的class-iNCD方法在最终准确率上高出5%以上，在细粒度数据集上验证了实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境。

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效解决无标注数据下的增量学习问题，在保持性能的同时降低了标注成本，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Motivation: 合成医疗数据虽然可扩展，但与真实临床环境存在显著领域差距，限制了其在真实世界中的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表示等方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges框架，学习共享的领域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任意领域对之间的无缝转换，无需领域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift相比基于扩散的方法具有更小的模型规模但性能强劲，在推理时可根据需要优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的领域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，在X-DigiSkull新数据集上展现了优异的跨域翻译能力。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可扩展的全球高分辨率树木监测框架，适用于未来更好卫星图像的监测需求，为生态系统功能、气候调节和生物经济研究提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，在保持高质量渲染的同时大幅提升了训练效率

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，统一最先进的OOD检测器到一个更有效的评分函数中，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，结合最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效提升OOD检测性能，多方法集成策略对各种类型的OOD样本都具有更好的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，现代方法转向单词级处理但仍受限于单词分割瓶颈。作者观察到需要进一步发展到行级OCR来避免单词检测错误并提供更大的句子上下文。

Method: 提出从单词级OCR到行级OCR的自然演进方法，直接处理整行文本图像，绕过单词分割步骤，利用更大的上下文信息来提升识别准确率。

Conclusion: 行级OCR是文档图像处理的重要进步，能够更好地利用语言模型，随着大语言模型的持续改进，该方法具有进一步发展的潜力。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Motivation: 传统数据增强方法会过度增强图像背景或无关区域，引入不必要干扰导致误检，这些错误并非对抗补丁本身造成

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗攻击效果，为船舶检测安全提供新的防御思路

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而加剧，并提出了位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的视频幻觉基准主要关注短视频，而忽略了长视频中由于语义复杂性增加导致的语义聚合幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了ELV-Halluc基准来系统研究SAH；通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系；探讨了位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建了包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；采用位置编码和DPO策略后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的基准和方法来解决。位置编码和DPO训练是缓解SAH的有效策略，为提升视频多模态模型的可靠性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，将低分辨率基础模型特征与输入图像结合，实现高效显微镜图像特征提取和分割，显著提升细粒度特征表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于patch的视觉基础模型在处理显微镜图像时存在两个问题：1) 难以表示微图像中的精细特征 2) 难以处理材料科学和生物图像分析中的大尺寸图像

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用更少的标签和更短时间就能产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基础模型在显微镜图像分析中的性能，为材料科学和生物图像分析提供了高效的特征提取和分割解决方案

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HCCM框架，通过区域-全局图像文本对比学习和匹配学习，解决无人机场景中视觉语言理解的细粒度语义和动态环境挑战，在GeoText-1652和ERA数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中宽视场和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解提出挑战，现有主流视觉语言模型缺乏细粒度语义，分层方法依赖精确实体划分和严格包含关系，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: HCCM框架包含两个组件：(1)区域-全局图像文本对比学习(RG-ITC)，避免精确场景划分，通过对比局部视觉区域与全局文本来捕获分层局部到全局语义；(2)区域-全局图像文本匹配(RG-ITM)，评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性，增强组合推理。还引入动量对比和蒸馏机制提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%的图像检索Recall@1和14.7%的文本检索Recall@1，在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的性能表现和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的单图像3D场景重建方法，使用高斯泼溅技术从单张图像生成完整的3D场景，包括被遮挡部分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要密集观测，无法重建被遮挡和未观测区域，且回归方法只能预测单一模式，导致模糊和不真实的结果

Method: 使用变分自重构器从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后在该空间上训练扩散模型，生成条件于单张输入图像的3D高斯泼溅表示分布

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建和多样化样本，完成被遮挡表面，实现高质量的360度渲染

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式建模解决了单图像3D重建中的遮挡和未观测区域问题，相比传统方法有显著改进

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

TL;DR: EZ-Sort通过CLIP零样本预排序和不确定性引导的MergeSort算法，将成对比较标注成本降低90.5%，同时保持或提高评分者间可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较虽然比绝对评分更可靠，但需要O(n^2)次标注，计算成本高昂。现有方法将标注负担降至O(n log n)，但仍需进一步优化效率

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行分层零样本预排序；2) 用自动化比较替代简单明显的人工比较；3) 初始化桶感知Elo分数；4) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同MergeSort

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计(FGNET)、历史图像年代学(DHCI)、视网膜图像质量评估(EyePACS)。相比穷举成对比较减少90.5%人工标注成本，相比先前工作减少19.8%(n=100时)，同时保持或提高评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，从第一人称视角建模人-物交互是一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究仅从头部和手腕跟踪中能恢复多少交互信息。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，在头部中心规范空间中操作，使用基于传送带的推理方法处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估表明，ECHO在自我中心人-物交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小观察中统一恢复人体姿态、物体运动和接触三种模态的框架，为可穿戴设备的人-物交互建模提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种现成视觉语言模型在城市场景中的空间推理能力，通过构建合成VQA数据集进行微调，显著提升了模型性能，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景预训练后，在城市场景中的细粒度空间推理能力转移效果尚未充分探索，需要系统评估和提升模型在城市场景的专业能力。

Method: 使用BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种模型，构建基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，并配备LLM生成的链式思维答案进行微调。

Result: 零样本设置下模型表现尚可，但使用合成CoT监督数据集微调后性能大幅提升，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究提出了城市场景空间推理作为VLM的新挑战，并证明合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的实用路径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学成像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育跟踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文或专注于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，这是一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特殊情况。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学图像时间动态建模的根本空白，提供了一个统一的生成框架，在4D医学图像预测任务上表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，整合术前CT和术后病理切片图像，用于透明细胞肾癌的复发风险预测，发现病理图像具有更强的预后价值，中间融合策略能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分在透明细胞肾癌复发风险分层中应用广泛，但存在患者层面分辨率有限且缺乏影像信息的局限性，需要开发更精准的多模态预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，整合术前CT和术后病理全切片图像。

Result: 病理图像模型始终优于CT-only模型，中间融合进一步改善性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。随机平局处理显示离散化可能高估个体化性能。

Conclusion: 基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中具有可行性，未来需要探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大规模多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 当前深度学习基于CGH算法存在三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系、CNN算法感知野有限、ASM基方法仅限于近场。需要一种新的方法来提高重建的准确性和稳定性。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复数去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD通过复数变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上达到了最先进的结果，PSNR超过35dB，显著提升了重建性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习的优势，有效解决了CGH重建中的几个关键问题，为计算机生成全息图领域提供了一种更灵活和高性能的方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，映射精度不足影响最终矢量化HD地图质量。

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过新颖的概率投影机制和置信度分数来：(1) 优化映射以更好地与场景对齐；(2) 过滤不影响HD地图生成的无关元素；(3) 使用置信度分数选择性地累积时间上的可靠信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上实验表明，性能优于最先进方法，泛化能力更好，在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战性场景中改进尤为显著。

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度引导的映射优化和过滤，有效提高了HD地图构建的精度和泛化能力，特别是在复杂场景和长距离感知方面表现突出。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活层的熵值变化，无需修改模型即可实时检测对抗性攻击，准确率达90%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或影响原始模型性能，需要一种无需修改模型就能实时检测的方法

Method: 在VGG-16等CNN模型的早期卷积层并行监测激活熵值，利用对抗性输入导致的熵值变化特征进行检测

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵值产生7%的偏移，检测准确率达到90%，误报率和漏报率均低于20%

Conclusion: CNN激活熵值能够有效编码分布偏移，通过监测熵值变化可以实现实时对抗性攻击检测，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，用于提升大型视觉语言模型在数字测量设备读数任务中的性能，特别是在复杂现实环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在数字测量设备读数任务中表现不佳，特别是在存在杂乱、遮挡、极端视角和运动模糊等现实条件下。这些限制在头戴式摄像头和增强现实应用中尤为常见。

Method: 开发了CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术，生成多样化的VQA标注合成DMD数据集。同时创建了DMDBench验证集，包含1000张标注的真实世界图像。

Result: 使用平均归一化Levenshtein相似度(ANLS)对三个最先进的LVLM进行基准测试，并通过CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集对LoRA进行微调，获得了显著改进。InternVL模型的得分提高了200%，且在其他任务上没有性能下降。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET训练数据集显著提高了LVLM在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和性能。该工具将作为开源发布，允许社区添加不同的测量设备并生成自己的数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Conclusion: 通过引入负例音频训练和新的评估框架，显著提升了视听源定位模型在复杂真实场景中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI代理是实现自动化移动/PC设备操作的重要任务，但面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型能力限制等挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，并开发课程强化学习框架支持复杂推理和在线环境探索；收集超过100万步操作轨迹，建立离线/在线评估环境。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对基础模型（如CLIP）的域泛化评估存在局限性，因为网络规模的预训练数据可能已经覆盖了许多基准测试。需要更真实地评估CLIP在遇到真正未见过的挑战性数据时的表现。

Method: 提出了CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独的域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化域数据；3）鼓励从域特征中解耦实现领域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中实现有效领域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过解耦方法成功提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频学习中使用非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单地将非典型数据加入训练过程也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对不常见的新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。论文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型数据（如科幻、动画等）的新视频数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，重点研究OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明：1）使用非典型数据能持续提升各任务性能；2）增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能；3）在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集优于使用较大但更典型的数据集；4）在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性帮助模型更好地泛化到未见动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域得到的关注不够。现有研究主要集中于有监督持续学习，依赖标签和任务边界知识，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行深度评估，无需使用任何标签或类别边界，证明方法显著提升了多任务学习性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个实用的解决方案，通过非参数方法有效地处理视频数据的复杂性，为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持中的潜力，特别是在放射肿瘤学这一专业领域的应用表现。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例的治疗方案生成，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于前代模型；在真实病例中正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需严格的专家监督，不能直接用于临床实践。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要创建更全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的全面测试。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练实验。

Result: 1) 现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变化和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素(光照、视角、距离、天气)的敏感性；4) 预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，同时证明了通过专门训练可以显著提升模型在复杂驾驶场景中的理解和推理能力，对自动驾驶系统的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.
